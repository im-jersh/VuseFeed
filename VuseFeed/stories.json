  "ARTICLE": "More money was bet on Michigan State to win the NCAA tournament than any other team at multiple sportsbooks. That money will be staying in-house.\n\nMiddle Tennessee, a 16½-point underdog, knocked off the Spartans 90-81 on Friday in St. Louis. The Blue Raiders were 20-1 to win the game straight and became the eighth No. 15 seed to beat a No. 2 seed.\n\nWilliam Hill's Nevada sportsbook took 78 money-line bets on Middle Tennessee, the largest a $265 wager that netted $5,300. A disappointed Spartans bettor risked $150 on the money-line at -7,000 odds. The wager would have netted $2.15.\n\nThe Spartans were the most popular bet to win the NCAA tournament at the Westgate SuperBook in both money and number of tickets after the bracket was released. Michigan State, the No. 2 seed in the East Region, was the tournament favorite or co-favorite at most sportsbooks with odds around 9-2. Middle Tennessee could be found as long as 2,000-1. The Westgate took one $5 bet on the Blue Raiders to win it all.\n\nEighteen percent of all the money bet on William Hill's odds to win the NCAA tournament was on the Spartans, including a $50,000 futures bet that would have paid $325,000. Only Kansas attracted more money at William Hill.\n\nCaesars sportsbook said Michigan State was by far its biggest liability. There were four bets on Middle Tennessee compared with 513 on the Spartans.\n\nMiddle Tennessee's upset continued a strong start to the NCAA tournament for Las Vegas books. The first Thursday of the 2015 tournament produced the biggest single-day win other than the Super Bowl for both the MGM and Golden Nugget sports books. This year's first full day was almost as good, MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood said. The Nugget reported a similar result. Caesars sportsbooks won $1 million company-wide Thursday.\n\nAfter a rough start, bettors battled back Friday night, when a run of wild finishes mostly went against the house and electrified the crowds at the sportsbooks. The biggest decision of the early slate was the Oklahoma-Cal State-Bakersfield game. Eighty-five percent of spread bets on the game were on the Sooners -14.5. Oklahoma won 82-68. As the Sooners dribbled out the final 15 seconds, the desperate crowd yelled, \"shoot\" and \"foul\" at the Westgate SuperBook.\n\nMiddle Tennessee and Cal State-Bakersfield covering the spread produced multiple six-figure wins for Caesars.\n\nThings turned around for bettors in the late slate with Notre Dame and Wisconsin rallying in the second half to win and cover the spread.\n\nNorthern Iowa's half-court buzzer-beater that knocked off Texas sent up a roar that could be heard throughout the MGM Grand hotel. Sixty-one percent of the money was on Northern Iowa at William Hill. Oregon, Xavier and St. Joe's winning and covering also was good for bettors at most shops.\n\n\"Not a good day, lost everything late,\" CG Technology vice president of race and sports Jason Simbal said late Friday. \"Wisconsin and Notre Dame were the main public parlay sides.\"\n\nUnderdogs went 9-7 against the spread Friday, with six outright winners. For the first two days, favorites covered the spread in 16 games, and underdogs covered the spread in 16 games."

  "SUMMARY": "Klay Thompson dropped 39 points in the Warriors' 130-112 victory over the Mavs.",
  "IMAGE_LINK": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0318%2Fr64709_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570",
  "ARTICLE": "After a 130-112 win over the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr summarized the effort with: \"In the end, we had to count on everybody. We played every guy on our roster, and I thought everybody contributed.\" That was roughly true, but especially true because Klay Thompson had stretches of being the rock with which \"everybody\" could steady themselves.\n\nMany offensive contributions were called for on a night when the Mavericks started off carving the Warriors' defense (Dirk Nowitzki going against Andrew Bogut at the five paid early dividends for Dallas). For years, Golden State has struggled to get those contributions when Stephen Curry sits. If one had to nitpick a team that could reasonably win more than 73 games, this is an area to target. Sans Curry, the offense falls apart.\n\nThat is, unless, Thompson can regularly offer performances half as good as Friday night's shooting clinic. Not only were Thompson's 39 points with 10 3-pointers impressive at face value, but he did so much of his damage as Curry rested. In the 11 minutes Thompson played without Curry, he scored 23 points on 8-of-10 shooting.\n\nThat's quite a feat considering how spacing starved those Curry-less lineups are. Also impressive was Thompson's approach. He was methodical, and though incandescent, refrained from decadent shot-hunting. On how he kept himself from gunning, Thompson said, \"Something I just matured into, I think. Not trying to go out there and do it all myself, but realize we got such a deep, talented team that the ball's eventually going to find me if I just stay with it. Don't force it.\"\n\nIn this way, Thompson has to rely on the \"everybody\" Kerr referenced. Though he can pitch in as a No. 1 option, he's not yet suited to being a one-man offense in the manner Curry can call up. Thompson still has to work for his shots, moving side to side, using screens, and trusting his teammates will help him out. In turn, he can't abuse their trust by playing too selfishly.\nThere's a zen to the approach that borders on spiritual. Or, as Thompson put the ethos, \"I believe in the basketball gods, too. If you're forcing shots out there, that's not a good thing to do.\"\n\nThompson's exploits weren't all of the scoring variety, though. As Kerr put it, \"He was hot all night and fighting on defense. They've got so many guards who can penetrate and they set so many high screens and I thought Klay really battled defensively.\"\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Thompson hounded the smaller J.J. Barea, chasing him around screens. During Curry's fourth-quarter rest, Thompson snatched a Barea pass and later swatted his layup into the backboard. This was not Golden State's best defensive performance, but Thompson and Shaun Livingston applied enough pressure near the end to help snuff out the Mavericks' attack.\n\nIt should be noted that Curry finished with 31 points, 10 assists and 9 boards (ho-hum). The most memorable of his makes was a banked-in corner 3 over Nowitzki. Maybe it's random, or maybe just illustrative of how charmed a stretch it has been for Golden State, but Curry has now banked in 10 3-pointers this season; no other player boasts more than two such shots.\n\nOn the not-so-charmed part of the ledger, Bogut strained his left big toe and probably will sit out Saturday's hyped game against San Antonio. Kerr joked that a braver man would cede Saturday to the Spurs, in a style of forfeiture associated with Gregg Popovich. \"If I had any guts at all I'd sit everybody tomorrow,\" a smiling Kerr said. \"It's like our sixth game in nine nights, national TV. If I was Pop I would sit everybody tomorrow. But I don't have that kind of courage.\"\n\nActually playing this game seems more daunting than ducking it. The Spurs have yet to lose at home and the Warriors are without Andre Iguodala, Festus Ezeli and (probably) Bogut. For Golden State to win, the Warriors might need everybody again. Or the basketball gods. Or both, plus another banked-in Curry triple."

  "ARTICLE": "With the Tampa Bay Rays playing against Cuba in a spring training game on Tuesday in Havana, various Cuban players in the West Coast's Cactus League shared thoughts on their hopes and aspirations in the major leagues, from excelling at the highest level to adjusting to daily life.\n\nLike L.A. Dodgers pitcher Yaisel Sierra, who hopes to find a new life both on and off the field in a league he says the vast majority of his countrymen dream of one day reaching.\n\n\"Since I was very young I always wondered what the major leagues would be like,\" Sierra said. \"It's like a dream to be here and to mix with these great stars I used to hear about.\"\n\nSierra, 24, is one of the new breed of Cuban baseball players who have been consistently advancing to the majors in recent years in the hope of making their millions. But they also want to prove that they are good enough ballplayers to compete with anyone.\n\n\"The difficult part was leaving my family behind. I have a 6-year-old son in Cuba. That's the hardest thing,\" Sierra said.\n\nSierra is one of four Cuban-born players at Dodgers spring camp, alongside catcher Yasmani Grandal, Alex Guerrero and star Yasiel Puig.\n\n\"For us, baseball is a culture, a way of life,\" Sierra said. \"We have proven at various levels and tournaments that we can play against the best.\n\n\"And the guys who have come here before have also proven this.”\n\nLast season, a record 27 Cuban baseball players played in Major League Baseball.\n\nHistorian Peter Bjarkman, an expert on Cuban baseball who will soon publish his book \"Cuban Baseball Defectors: The Inside Story,\" says that at least 25 Cuban players have signed major league contracts worth more than $1 million in the past six years.\n\n\"The first thing is we gradually need to acclimatize to the team, to the baseball, to life over here,\" Sierra said. \"In my case, I need to work on my control to ensure that I reach the level of excellence required by the major leagues.\"\n\nSierra's L.A. teammate Guerrero said Cuban baseball players have all the tools to compete at almost any position.\n\n\"It's an honor for me to play with these compatriots and those who come to Major League Baseball, especially for a team as famous as the Dodgers,\" Guerrero said.\n\n\"Seguro van a venir más. Para mí es un orgullo y una satisfacción demostrar que el béisbol de Cuba tiene alto nivel, por encima de todos los obstáculos que tenemos ... demostrar que hay buenos peloteros. Sólo hay que ayudarnos entre nosotros, \" Guerrero said in his native tongue.\n\nTranslated: \"More players are sure to come over. It gives me great pride and satisfaction to show the high standard of Cuban baseball, in spite of all the obstacles we face ... to show that there are good ballplayers. We just need to help each other.\"\n\nGuerrero said there is a good relationship among the Cubans playing in the big leagues thanks to the fact that they share the same culture, the same language and similar customs from the same homeland.\n\nNew Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Guerrero will work almost exclusively at third base this spring, but Roberts knows Guerrero is also capable of playing shortstop, second base and even in the outfield.\n\n\"It has been very difficult to adapt to baseball here,\" Guerrero conceded. \n\n\"The game here is very different from in Cuba. On top of that, the language and culture are a struggle and, of course, the standard is higher. This is the best baseball in the world.\"\n\nPitching is among the main differences Guerrero has found in MLB compared to Cuba. He said there are more major league pitchers who are able to pitch fast breaking balls.\n\nHe also mentioned that the standard of defense and athleticism among many MLB players, including those of Latin American origin, is higher than the average he experienced in the Cuban Serie Nacional, for example.\n\n\"The main advice I would give the young players coming over is to train, to give their all, to ignore the obstacles,\" the 29-year-old Cuban said. \"This is difficult, but if you set your mind to it, you'll get there.\"\n\nAccording to Miami-based OnCuba magazine, 150 Serie Nacional players left Cuba in 2015, though many of them still have no contract with Major League Baseball organizations.\n\nGuillermo Heredia, a native of Matanzas, Cuba, just signed a contract with the Seattle Mariners in the first week of March.\n\nUnlike Puig, Sierra and Guerrero, who have virtually guaranteed their places on the Dodgers' roster to start the season, Heredia will have to compete at his highest level in spring practices and Cactus League games to earn a spot on the Mariners' Opening Day team.\n\n\"This isn't as easy as you might believe in Cuba,\" Heredia said. \"You hear about Yasiel [Puig], Aroldis [Chapman], Jose Contreras and all the other guys who have been successful and you think it will happen for you overnight.\"\n\n\"I have to work hard here because there are so many stars on this team.\" he added. “But I think I can make it. If they decide I should start in the minors, so be it. I'll carry on working to achieve my dream of playing in the major leagues.\"\n\nHeredia pointed to Cuban players' speed on the basepaths and defensive skills as some of their top baseball credentials.\n\nHe also said he felt that being surrounded by fellow Latinos on the Seattle squad and in particular another Cuban, Leonys Martin, will help him in his aim to conquer the major leagues with the Mariners.\n\n\"This won't be easy,\" said Martin, who joined the ranks of American professional baseball with the Texas Rangers in 2010 and spent almost his entire first two years with minor league affiliates. \"There is a lot of talent at this level. You have to be professional 24 hours a day and improve your game at all times or you'll never establish yourself here.\"\n\n\"I've learned a lot here,\" Martin added. \"I had to learn to be professional in the system that's in place here, and that's something that anyone coming over will have to learn. I want to be a great inspiration for all of them.\"\n\nRelatively few Cuban players arrived before 2000, but among those who did were some big names like Orlando \"El Duque\" Hernandez, Rolando Arrojo, Danys Baez, Jose Hernandez and Ariel Prieto. And before that, it was Jose Canseco, Tony Oliva, Tony Perez and Rafael Palmeiro, among others.\n\nMartin said that despite the fame and fortune that many Cuban ballplayers have found in the United States, they still have a huge task ahead of them that many dream to accomplish.\n\n\"For all of us in baseball, our great objective is to one day represent our country in the World Baseball Classic,\" he said. \"Because, although we come to play here, representing your country is another huge thing.\"\n\nPuig agreed with Martin on the topic of the pride players feel representing Cuba.\n\n\"Here we are playing for Cuba every hour of every day,\" the Dodgers star said. \"It would be amazing to play a World Baseball Classic as Cubans in the majors. In the meantime, we need to keep on 'pushing forward and showing that Cubans can play baseball with the best of them."

  "ARTICLE": "They will arrive, sweaters casually draped over their shoulders and clutching Kate Spade bags, their sockless feet shoved into loafers and their collars perfectly popped, to root for their team -- either the undermanned scrappers from that rough-and-tumble campus of Duke University or the plucky underdogs from the hardscrabble world of Yale University.\n\nAnd America will pause to light a candle and mourn the temporary death of March Madness, when the light-beer game stepped aside for the Chardonnay crowd.\n\nDuke versus Yale, elite versus upper-crust, Biff versus Bronwyn.\n\nThe two teams' tale of the tape does not just include points per game for each team (81.5 for Duke, 75.2 for Yale) but also the average SAT score for the Class of 2019 (between 1400 and 1590 for Duke; and 1410-1590 for Yale) and their acceptance rates (11 percent for Duke, 6.3 for Yale).\n\nIt's an easy layup of a comparison, one that doesn't frankly play out on the basketball court at all -- down to seven guys, the Blue Devils have made their way on grit more than glamour, while the Yalies rely on their defense and rebounding -- but why should that stop anyone?\n\nSince the two teams won their first-round NCAA tournament games Thursday to set up Saturday's game, a thousand memes and GIFs have been born in their honor, plenty finding their way to the players' social media feeds.\n\nSo to get to the bottom of this issue of Preppy Power Play, we decided to ask the tough questions:\n\nWhat's the toughest or most interesting class you've taken?\nDuke:\n\nChase Jeter: \"Anthropology of media, film and Facebook. The title is a little misleading. It sounds easier than it is. Like anything with anthropology, you've always got to ask the question, 'Why? Why? Why?'\"\n\nMarshall Plumlee: \"Biodiversity. It looks at conservationism and extinction rates about a variety of species.\"\n\nMatt Jones: \"Probably a computer science class I'm taking right now. It's pretty challenging.

That wasn't hard but it was interesting, just looking at finance and business and how psychology plays a role.\"\n\nBrandon Ingram: \"Public speaking. I think I'm pretty good at it, but it was interesting, the teacher made it interesting with the assignments she gave us.\"\n\nYale:\n\nBlake Reynolds: \"Bioethics and law. It's a little tough. It's dealing with the legal and moral impacts on different medical cases, like medical malpractice and the ethics and legality of it all.\"\n\nAnthony Dallier: \"I'd say freshman year calculus. I got a B-minus, but going into the final, you could have told me I would have gotten anywhere from a B-plus to a D and I would have believed you. Yeah I was going to be an economics major but I realized I wasn't really a math guy, so that's why I switched to political science.\"\n\nNick Victor: \"I took a class on the Rwandan genocide and it talked about what preceded it, and the different approaches that have come out because of it.\"\n\nBrandon Sherrod: \"The moral foundation of politics. It was very dense and it was taught in a lecture format, so you didn't have as much of an intimate conversation and relationship with your professor.\" Asked if he could then explain the Donald Trump phenomenon, Sherrod laughed. \"That's pretty unexplainable.\"\n\nDo you have a thesis due anytime soon?\n\nYale: Yes. Victor turned in his on for-profit colleges and how they target lower-income communities in December. \"I had like 40 pages to write in three weeks.\" Justin Sears and Brandon Sherrod are currently working on theirs. Sears has a book to read and a movie to watch on Rwandan genocide, his thesis topic. \"Yeah, it really brings you down and I don't want to do that right now. It's March.\" Sherrod is six pages (double-spaced) into an at least 25-page paper on the quality of education at charter schools in Bridgeport, Connecticut, versus public schools there and whether charter schools should receive state funding. \"It's really hard when you're on the road.\"\n\nDuke: No. Allen on Sears' thesis: \"Wow, that sounds a little bit challenging. Props to him for trying to do that in March.\" Ingram: \"What? No, I don't think I could do that.\"\n\nPopped collars and Vineyard Vine labels on your campus?\n\nDuke: Yes. Jones: \"We see guys with the jeans, sweaters, that whole alumni look. You definitely see it. Me? I wear my Duke-issued hoodie and gear.\"\n\nYale: Yes. \"I'd say a rough estimate, maybe 20 to 40 percent of our students wear that. I don't. I'm kinda broke.\"\n\nDo you own a pair of boat shoes?\n\nDuke: Yes: Allen, sort of. \"I don't now, but I wore them in high school but we had to wear a uniform.\" No: Ingram, Jones.\n\nYale: Yes. \"Looking around this room, maybe 30 percent,\" Sears said. Told Dallier owns a pair, Sears amended his estimate. \"Anthony wears them? Do you Blake? OK, maybe 50 percent.\"\n\nSinging center Whippenpoof?\n\nDuke: No. \"No, no I can't sing at all,\" senior Plumlee said. His biggest worry? Rejoining his ROTC battalion and finishing the paperwork for his spring commissioning in the Army.\n\nYale: Yes. Sherrod spent a year with the elite singing troupe and still sings to himself at the free-throw line."

  "ARTICLE": "Kevin Durant's free-agency decision may now come a few days earlier.\n\nThe NBA and NBA Players Association have agreed to shorten this summer's free-agent moratorium by five days, a person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.\n\nNew deals struck this summer may now be signed on July 7 at 12:01 a.m., according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because neither side announced the move publicly.\n\nTeams were informed of the decision on Thursday. Yahoo! Sports also reported the news.\n\nUntil now, this summer's moratorium was scheduled to run through July 11, with players and teams able to execute new deals on July 12. The moratorium -- which exists in large part to allow the league time to calculate the exact amount of the salary cap and luxury-tax figure for the coming season -- will run from July 1-6.\n\nBoth the league and the union had to sign off on the switch, which could help both sides. Teams and free agents can agree to deals during the moratorium, but nothing can be signed until it ends. By shortening the moratorium, the league and its teams will have the luxury of getting deals done more quickly -- and it could help prevent a situation like the one that overshadowed free agency last summer.\n\nDeAndre Jordan agreed during last summer's moratorium to sign with the Dallas Mavericks, then changed his mind several days later and ultimately stayed with the Los Angeles Clippers. While changes of heart like that could still occur, of course, teams probably won't complain about having the ability to get signatures on contracts more quickly going forward.\n\nFree agency is expected to be particularly hectic this summer, with Durant headlining a list of players who could be on the move. Others who could become free agents include LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Al Horford, Pau Gasol, Mike Conley, Hassan Whiteside and DeMar DeRozan."

  "ARTICLE": "There will be no misdirection, no shroud of secrecy and no cavalcade of trucks leaving Rams Park under the cover of night. No, the Rams' return to Los Angeles will be far more straightforward.\n\nThe Rams officially became property of Los Angeles again when the NFL announced their approval for relocation on Jan. 12. But the team's business and football operations have remained in St. Louis in the time since. That time is almost up, as the Rams intend to be out of their St. Louis facilities by the end of next week.\n\nThe move has already begun. The Rams shut down their business and scouting operations Friday and will close down the football operations next week, which will be the final period any sort of Rams business takes place in St. Louis.\n\nThe first moving trucks departed Rams Park on March 7 for the nearly 2,000-mile journey to the greater Los Angeles area. Six more trucks have begun the approximately 28-hour journey since, but that movement is expected to pick up next week. The Lombardi Trophy from the team's victory in Super Bowl XXXIV is among the items currently en route to Los Angeles.\n\nBruce Warwick, the Rams' director of operations, estimates that 30 semitrucks, each carrying between 20,000 and 22,000 pounds of cargo, will be required to complete the move.\n\n\"All football operations will be shut down next Friday, so that's when you are going to really start seeing trucks today, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\" Warwick said Friday. \"And it's just going to be a constant, just load and go.\"\n\nThat \"load and go\" process will be the result of tireless work from Warwick, who has spent every week since the move was announced trekking between St. Louis and Los Angeles. He spends most of his weekdays on the West Coast, returning to St. Louis for the weekends before flying back out. \nAlthough there's no definitive number yet, Warwick said the team and the moving company will tag about 25,000 items to be moved via those trucks.\n\nTo keep track of everything, the Rams and the moving company built an internal website where they can track and monitor everything that gets moved. Those items are tagged, photographed and cataloged so when they are needed again, the Rams have a database that tells them where an item is and where it needs to go.\n\nFor now, most of the trucks to move early are taking the Rams' items to a warehouse in Anaheim. That's because most of the items that have already departed are not going to be needed for the team's offseason program in Oxnard or for training camp, which is expected to take place in Irvine. Rams Park has been mostly cleared out; however, some of the modular furniture like the cubicles in the media room will stay behind.\n\nThe last trucks to leave will carry things like weight room equipment, which is still needed in St. Louis for players rehabbing from injury, and it won't be required in Los Angeles until the offseason program begins in Oxnard on April 18. Other trucks, such as those carrying items for business operations, will be needed sooner. The business side is expected to resume in the Agoura Hills area on a temporary basis while the Rams continue to seek a permanent home.\n\nWith the business side expected to make two moves, the football side also has three moves to make, including the initial one to Oxnard, followed by training camp in Irvine and then to the anticipated in-season home in the Thousand Oaks area. Modular trailers will be constructed for the football operations in Thousand Oaks.\n\nAll of those moving parts are the most difficult piece of the puzzle, according to Warwick.\n\n\"It's going to be tricky for the football side as we move to three different locations in the next five months,\" Warwick said. \"It's not like we're going for a day or two. We have all of our stuff with us that's not in the warehouse so we've tried to be smart as far as how we pack, what we need, putting things in pods and things like that. We can transport from location to location to location so we're not unloading, reloading and all that other stuff.\"\n\nThe moving company is also handling the personal moves for team employees, about 20 to 25 of whom will be heading west to begin business operations April 4.\n\nPart of the team's timeline included figuring out what to take with them. Warwick has long been a stickler for clearing out clutter and has encouraged employees to go through with a yearly purge of non-essential items. Everyday items are also not part of the move.\n\n\"It's California,\" Warwick said. \"They sell Gatorade out there. They sell staplers. They sell paper clips. Anything that is not essential stuff, we'll secure it out there.\"\n\nThe Rams' leftover items they aren't taking have been donated to local charities the team has worked with in the past. That includes everything from office supplies to St. Louis Rams branded apparel.\n\nWhat becomes of the Rams' former Earth City headquarters remains to be seen. The building and the three practice fields behind it are controlled by the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex. Some have mentioned it as a possible home for a future Major League Soccer franchise, but no determination has been made to this point.\n\nBefore completely moving out, Warwick said the Rams will do their best to do necessary maintenance to the parts of the building that might be damaged by the move.\n\n\"We do have some cleanup to do,\" Warwick said. \"We do have some repairs to do.\"\n\nAnd after that? Facilities manager Lee Martin will turn out the lights on the Rams' time in St. Louis."

  "SUMMARY": "Kirk Cousins finished the 2015 season with 29 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions.",
  "IMAGE_LINK": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F1011%2Fr15921_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570",
  "ARTICLE": "The thick beard has been replaced by stubble that comes from going a day without shaving. That might be the only thing different about Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins since he signed his franchise tender, a one-year contract worth nearly $20 million.\n\nThe intensity and drive that marked his surprising rise last year in his first full season as a starter are still evident when you speak to him. He insists that determination won't diminish despite being scheduled to earn nearly $17.5 million more than he did in his first four seasons combined.\n\n\"I never played football thinking about money, and going forward I never want to play football thinking about money,\" Cousins said. \"That's why I think it's important for me to play with a salary that's just locked in. I don't want to be thinking about individual accomplishments or rewards that would boost my salary or up my numbers. I just want to go out and play football and try and win games. So whether I'm making what I made last year [$660,000] or this year, I just want to play football and treat it like I did back in high school and love playing. It's a tremendous blessing to be paid to play this game the way I will this year.\"\n\nCousins and Washington have until July 15 to negotiate a multiyear contract, but the former Michigan State star said he's comfortable playing under the franchise tag for 2016 if a long-term agreement fails to materialize.\n\n\"Discussions are always ongoing,\" he said. \"You're never really finished. It's a process and I think much like the process of preparing for a football game, you're not ready to play the game on Wednesday; you prepare to get ready for Sunday. I think negotiations often work that way. You know that maybe it's not Sunday yet -- it's Wednesday in this negotiation -- and we're just taking steps toward what will eventually be Sunday. So we'll see. Obviously it gets more interesting as it gets closer to 'game day,' if you will.\n\n\"But I'm not too worried about it. I'm very content in the situation I'm in and love the opportunity to prove myself again next season. I feel like it's only fair if that's what's asked of me -- to go out and prove it, that I ought to be a starting quarterback. That's OK with me.\"\n\nMany were stunned last year when Cousins was named the starter shortly before the season opener. The job was supposed to belong to Robert Griffin III, for whom Washington surrendered three first-round picks and a second-round selection to move up four spots and draft No. 2 overall in 2012. Cousins was taken three rounds and 100 picks later in the same draft.\n\nGriffin started his career spectacularly, winning offensive rookie of the year after completing 65.5 percent of his passes for 3,200 yards and 20 touchdowns, with just five interceptions. He also rushed for 815 yards and seven scores. But injuries and inconsistency took hold from there, eventually prompting coach Jay Gruden to name Cousins the starter before Week 1 last season.\n\nIt was a bumpy ride early. Cousins had only limited opportunities to work with the starters in training camp, and the lack of chemistry showed. He threw multiple interceptions in four of his first six games, each contributing to a loss. Things got worse in Week 7, when Washington fell behind Tampa Bay 24-0 midway through the second quarter. Did Gruden make a mistake naming the starter? Was Cousins in over his head?\n\nCousins answered by leading the biggest comeback in franchise history, his 6-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Reed with 24 seconds to play producing a 31-30 victory that kicked off a march to the playoffs. Washington finished 7-3 over its final 10 games, with Cousins throwing for 23 touchdowns and only three interceptions during that time. It marked not only a tremendous finish to the season, but an interesting start to contract negotiations. In essence, Washington has said to him: We like you a lot, but we'd like you even more if you showed us you could do it again.\n\n\"There's no doubt that next year if I'm playing on the tag it's a great opportunity to prove yourself again, and that's OK,\" Cousins said. \"I think that's part of playing in this league and being in a lot of pressure situations and facing a lot of scrutiny. ... I was a much better quarterback going into that playoff game than I was going into Week 1, and I guess that's why there's a lot of excitement going forward 'cause you feel like if that much growth could take place -- not just in me as a player, but in our offense and in our team in 17 weeks -- why can't we continue to grow and take steps forward in our offseason program and training camp and go into another season? I think a lot of us are excited, especially on the offensive side of the ball, for some of the chemistry we've been able to build and the future that lies ahead. I think the key is to not get complacent.\"\n\nThe team and the offense now belong to Cousins for the foreseeable future. Washington left no doubt when it released Griffin on March 7.\n\n\"It was a good relationship,\" Cousins said of his time with Griffin. \"I go back to the very first day in Washington. He and I were roommates in the hotel at rookie minicamp and he had a laptop already and had already picked up some of the offense, and he sat me down and started showing me some of the plays he'd already learned and gave me the chance to continue to get a head start at rookie minicamp. That kind of relationship continued on from there for four years, and it wasn't a distraction at all in Year 4.\n\n\"He was a great teammate throughout the season and supportive, and he had a lot of experience having played a lot and was able to be a big help to me. So, it was a positive thing. ... It was a good relationship and I've always felt that way.\"\n\nCousins is in Hawaii for the NFL Players Association meetings. Executive director DeMaurice Smith repeatedly stresses the need for players to see football as a business and not just a game. Cousins took those words to heart during contract negotiations, acknowledging that he heard outside comments that he should take a lesser salary so the team could have more money to sign other players.\n\n\"I understand all perspectives on the issue,\" he said. \"I, as a fan, would understand why you'd say 'take a discount.' It certainly opens up salary cap space; it's gonna make it a lot easier on a general manager, on a team, to be able to have success. I understand where they're coming from. It's a little more complicated than that, but everybody's entitled to their own opinion and I'm certainly not gonna tell them that they have to think a certain way.\"\nWill money change Cousins? Those who know him doubt it. But the fifth-year veteran does admit that financial stability will bring about one change. That 2000 GMC van he drove to and from work in the past? It will be replaced -- or dare we say complemented? -- by a new vehicle.\n\n\"I'm gonna have that van as long as possible. Even when it dies I may just put a new engine in it and rebuild it for the sentimental value,\" Cousins said. \"Whether I drive it to work or not on a daily basis, like I did last year, that probably won't happen. I'll probably get a car to go to work back and forth. But it becomes a great car when family comes to town for games. FedEX Field's an hour and a half away from where I live in Ashburn, Virginia, so it's a nice, comfortable ride for seven to eight people. They'll come into town and all need a way to go to the game and we've got a TV in there, we've got a lot of leg room. So the van will stay and, if nothing else, will be a great way to get to and from games.\n\n\"So if you come to FedEx Field you'll see me driving off in that. Hopefully after a big win."

The Austrian beat Fabienne Suter of Switzerland by 0.13 seconds, with Elena Curtoni of Italy third, 0.17 behind.\n\nGut finished 13th.\n\nVonn clinched the downhill title before her crash in a super-G in Andorra last month and was in St. Moritz to pick up her 20th crystal globe.\n\n\"I feel like I had a really great year,\" Vonn said. \"Nine wins and to be able to still take home one globe at least even though I had to end my season early it means a lot because you work so hard and I was so close, I was leading four titles when I got hurt so to still have at least one, that was huge so I'm pretty excited about it.\"\n\nGut is only 19 points behind Vonn in the super-G standings, with the final race coming Thursday.\n\n\"I don't think super-G will hold but weirder things have happened in skiing,\" Vonn said. \"I'll be at the finish tomorrow and maybe a miracle will happen.\"\nPuchner's previous best finish was eighth in the downhill in Val d'Isere in December.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" the Austrian said. \"My goal for today was 10th place so to end up first is amazing. I'm really looking forward to the world championships next year here now.\"\n\nDaniela Merighetti of Italy crashed in what was her last event before retiring, landing badly after a jump. The race was halted briefly while she received treatment but she managed to ski down the rest of the course before being taken immediately to first aid.\n\nWith her downhill title, Vonn broke the mark of 19 crystal globes held by Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden. It was one of several records she broke this season and she is now only 10 behind Stenmark's all-time mark of 86 victories.\n\n\"Season-long titles are really difficult to get and Stenmark obviously is a legend and to have anything more than he's accomplished is pretty unbelievable,\" Vonn said. \"I'm very proud of that.\n\n\"Whether I get it (the all-time win record) next year or the following year, it's really irrelevant,\" Vonn added. \"My goals are the world championships and the Olympics. I think the Olympics is probably the biggest goal, but to break Stenmark's record would be amazing."

We will pull them in.\"\n\nHe also questioned whether Russia could complete a clean-up revolution in just four months; the country was accused of operating a vast, state-sponsored doping program in a report by a World Anti-Doping Agency commission and banned from international athletics last November.\n\n\"Nobody realistically expects to have a complete resolution to a problem people will recognise from even before my time as an athlete,\" Coe told the British newspaper.\n\nRussia will find out in May if it will be able to send an athletics team to the Olympic Games in Rio, after being told \"further significant work\" is required before its international suspension is lifted.\n\nCoe is fighting to restore the integrity of athletics after his sport was rocked by doping and corruption scandals. Five other nations -- Ethiopia, Morocco, Kenya, Ukraine and Belarus -- have all been told by the IAAF to make stern changes to their anti-doping programmes or risk joining Russia on an international athletics blacklist.\n\nHowever, with a contract until 2019 as president, he said: \"The return to trust may be beyond my time.

  "ARTICLE": "The six person jury in St. Petersburg, Florida -- four women and two men -- deliberated for nearly six hours.\n\nHogan, dressed all in black including a black bandana, cried when the verdict was announced.\n\nThe ex-wrestler, whose real name is Terry Bollea, had sued Gawker, founder Nick Denton and former editor A.J. Daulerio for posting the nearly two-minute segment of a Hogan sex tape in 2012. Hogan's suit claimed Gawker violated his privacy and sought $100 million.\n\n\"Mr. Bollea is exceptionally happy. This is not only his victory today, but also anyone else who's been victimized by tabloid journalism,\" his lawyer David Houston said outside the courtroom. Hogan stood quietly behind the lawyer, his sunglasses failing to conceal dried tears on his cheeks.\n\nBut he tweeted \"Thank you God for justice.\"\n\nThe jury must still consider whether to impose punitive damages next week.\n\n\"We're coming back Monday for the rest of it,\" Houston said.\n\nGawker's legal team, which had argued that posting the video was protected by the First Amendment, appeared to have anticipated a costly verdict. Lawyers for the New York news site issued a statement shortly after the jury retired to begin deliberations. The statement mentioned the jury's inability to consider a trove of recently unsealed documents related to the case.\n\n\"It may be necessary for the appeals court to resolve this case,\" the statement said.\n\nDenton read from a prepared statement outside the courthouse Friday evening that said, \"Given key evidence and the most important witness were both improperly withheld from this jury, we all knew the appeals court will need to resolve the case. ... That's why we feel very positive about the appeal that we have already begun preparing, as we expect to win this case ultimately.\"\n\nThe \"most important witness\" Denton referred to was radio host Bubba \"The Love Sponge\" Clem who made the video. The judge in the case quashed Gawker's subpoena to have Clem testify, citing his lack of trustworthiness.\n\nThe jury awarded Hogan $55 million for economic injuries and $60 million for emotional distress. Those same jurors will reconvene next week to consider punitive damages on top of the $115 million already awarded.\n\nFlorida law requires an appealing party to post a bond for the full amount of damages, but that requirement is capped at $50 million. Denton has been candid about the financial threat posed by the lawsuit. In January, he sold a minority stake in Gawker Media, which he founded in 2002, for the first time as an additional layer of protection.\n\nIn closing arguments earlier in the day, Hogan attorney Kenneth Turkel tried to paint the Gawker defendants as indecent gossip-mongers who make a mockery of journalism.\n\nTurkel told the jury that Daulerio \"didn't have the common decency\" to reach out to any of the parties involved before he posted the video excerpts and the commentary, which \"probably tells you all you need to know about Gawker.\"\n\nTurkel invoked a 2013 interview in which Denton said \"invasion of privacy has incredibly positive effects on society.\"\n\n\"Who thinks like that?\" the attorney asked incredulously.\n\nOn two occasions, Turkel seemed to suggest that Denton and his company don't share the Florida jury's values.\n\n\"This guy is up there in New York sitting behind a computer playing god with other people's lives,\" Turkel said of Denton. Turkel also scoffed that Daulerio wrote in his 2012 commentary that \"the Internet has made it easier for all of us to be shameless voyeurs and deviants.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure all of us are shameless voyeurs and deviants,\" Turkel said. \"They may be up there on Fifth Avenue at Gawker.\"\n\nGawker attorney Michael Sullivan restated the company's free speech argument that's been the bedrock of the defense's case. \nThe First Amendment, he told jurors, protects unpopular speech.\n\n\"What the plaintiff asks you to do is easy: to feel sympathy for Mr. Bollea, to muster your dislike and disdain for Gawker,\" Sullivan said. \"What we ask you to do is harder, very hard, but ultimately it is right.\"\n\nSullivan warned that Hogan's lawsuit could have a chilling effect on free press if \"powerful celebrities, politicians and public figures would use our courts to punish people.\"\n\n\"We will all be worse off as a result,\" he said.\n\nSullivan downplayed the raunchiness of the nearly two-minute video package that was posted on Gawker, which only included nine seconds of sex. He ridiculed Hogan's lawyers for opting against showing the excerpts in court.\n\nSullivan also sought to raise doubts that Hogan was unaware he was being recorded inside Clem's bedroom, where Hogan had sex with Clem's then-wife. The attorney noted that Hogan could be heard on the tape asking about cameras, and that the plaintiff was surely aware that Clem was in an open marriage and had a propensity for recording his wife in the act."

  "ARTICLE": "On Monday, March 21, at 10 a.m. PT, Apple will announce its latest product updates. The event will take place at Apple's Cupertino campus, a modest venue that holds fewer reporters and guests than other popular Apple event locations. The headliner is expected to be a smaller version of the iPhone, followed by a smaller version of the iPad Pro.\n\niPhone but smaller\n\nThe key marketing words for Apple products have usually been thinner, faster, bigger. iPhones have grown up over the past nine years, going from the original 3.5-inch display to the iPhone 6S Plus' 5.5-inch screen. On Monday, Apple is expected to go the opposite direction and announce a new iPhone that's actually smaller.\n\nLikely called the iPhone SE or iPhone 5SE, the new smartphone will feature a four-inch display, making it the same size as the three-year-old iPhone 5S. Externally it will bear only minor design changes. Even though its design is retro, the phone's internals will be all modern and on par with the iPhone 6S. Look for an A9 chip, better camera, and NFC for Apple Pay.\n\nWhy go small? Some market research has shown a demand for smaller phones. Apple already offers a range of Mac screen sizes, so why not make a different iPhone for every preference?\n\niPad Pro but smaller\n\nA new iPad will cram the power of the iPad Pro line in a smaller package. With a 9.7-inch display, the rumored iPad will look similar to the iPad Air line. But inside it will have the Pro's speedier processor. It will be able to connect to Apple's snap-on smart keyboards (expect a new smaller version of the keyboard just for this iPad). And stylus fans can rejoice, as the new iPad will work with the Apple Pencil.\n\nAnd because tablet photography refuses to die, the iPad could include much improved cameras and a rear-facing LCD flash for better-lit awkward photos.\n\nApple Watch but prettier\n\nThe invite for Monday's event said \"Let us loop you in.\" The event is taking place at 1 Infinite Loop, but more likely it's hinting at some new Apple Watch straps. The Apple Watch itself is expected to remain unchanged, but new bands are an easy way to keep up hype around the wearable before a full upgrade of the hardware.\n\nApple Event but in your living room\n\nApple often offers live streams of its big press events on the web. The carefully choreographed announcements are pretty entertaining for eager Apple fans. Sometimes they even include surprise musical guests.\n\nNow Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is offering a special Apple TV app just for watching Apple press events in the comfort of your own home. Called \"Apple Events\" the app is available for free in the app store."

  "ARTICLE": "General Mills said Friday that it will start labeling its products that contain genetically modified ingredients in response to a law going into effect in Vermont later this year.\n\nThe maker of Cheerios, Yoplait and Betty Crocker joins Campbell Soup as one of the few major consumer product companies to adopt labeling amid a contentious debate in Congress about whether identifying GMOs — genetically modified organisms — should be voluntary.\n\nIn a blog post, General Mills argued for a national standard for GMO labeling but said that in the meantime, the company will start labeling certain products that contain GMOs. The decision comes as General Mills and other food producers prepare to comply with a Vermont law that will require GMOs to be identified starting July 1. General Mills said that it's more cost effective to adopt the practice across the country in order to keep prices from rising for customers.\n\nThe labels will start hitting grocery stores over the next several weeks and customers can expect thousands of packages to be updated with new language, says General Mills spokesman Mike Siemienas.\n\nGeneral Mills also launched a tool that lets customers search for products that contain GMOs, which includes Betty Crocker frosting, Chex cereal and Nature Valley bars.\n\n\"We know that some consumers are interested in knowing which products contain GMO ingredients,\" said Jeff Harmening, chief operating officer for U.S. retail at General Mills.\n\nThe fight over GMO labeling has been fraught with the question of whether GMOs are safe to consume. Some advocacy groups say there hasn't been sufficient testing to determine whether GMOs pose a health risk. Genetically engineered foods, like corn and soybeans, have been part of the U.S. food supply since the 1990s and the Food and Drug Administration says they are safe to eat. In the blog post, Harmening reiterates General Mills' position that GMOs are safe.\n\nGeneral Mills owns several brands whose products don't contain GMOs, such as Annie's, Cascadian Farm and Larabar."

But Shell and Saudi Aramco have seen their interests head in different directions. \"It is now time for the partners to pursue their independent downstream goals,\" said Abdulrahman Al-Wuhaib, a senior vice president of Saudi Aramco’s downstream unit."

Pricing and stakes have not been decided, company spokeswoman Midori Hara said.\n\nCanon said in a statement that its acquisition of Toshiba Medical Systems Corp. as a 100 percent-owned subsidiary would aid its ambition to expand its medical equipment business. Toshiba Medical’s strengths are in X-ray and ultrasound systems.\n\nTokyo-based Toshiba has been struggling with a major scandal over disclosures that company officials doctored accounting books for years after setting unrealistic earnings targets.\n\nThe company also is facing major problems in its nuclear business after the March 2011 accident at a plant in Fukushima, northeastern Japan, which sent three reactors into meltdowns.\n\nBecause of a public outcry amid doubts about the technology’s safety, all but two power reactors in Japan remain shut down. Toshiba’s electronics devices operations have also taken a hit because of intensifying competition and dropping sales.\n\nFor the fiscal year through March, the company is forecasting a 710 billion yen ($6.3 billion) loss, even bigger than its initial projection. It will be the company’s second year of red ink.\n\nToshiba’s chief executive resigned last year to take responsibility for the scandal. But efforts to reform corporate governance have turned up even more accounting wrongdoing.\n\nJapanese corporate culture, with its emphasis on consensus, has often been blamed for systematic cover-ups at Japan’s most prestigious companies, including Olympus Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.\n\nUnlike some Western accounting scandals, such scandals in Japan did not result in enrichment of individual employees. Instead, workers collaborated to “save face” for the company."

  "ARTICLE": "It's safer to go to work now, but lots of people are still seriously injured on the job.\n\nA new report from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration shows that there were 10,388 severe injuries caused by workplace conditions in 2015. These injuries led to 7,636 hospitalizations and 2,644 amputations. In a handful of cases there were even reports of people having their eyes gouged out.\n\nOSHA collected the data from 26 states that have higher safety standards than those mandated by federal regulations. The reported cases amounted to 30 severe work-related injuries a day.\n\nThe manufacturing industry had the highest proportion of accidents -- it accounted for 57% of all amputations and 26% of all hospitalizations.\n\nAmong the other industries with high rates were construction, transportation and warehousing as well oil and gas extraction.\n\nThe report, which was released Thursday, is the result of new regulations, which require companies to report serious workplace accidents within 24 hours. The new regulatory system was implemented in 2015 to reduce the number of these injuries.\n\n\"Too often, we would investigate a fatal injury only to find a history of serious injuries at the same workplace. Each of those injuries was a wake-up call for safety that went unheeded,\" OSHA said in a statement.\n\nOSHA estimates that roughly 50% of all injuries in the 26 states where it collects data, aren't reported.\n\nOne possible reason for this is that smaller companies aren't aware of the new system.\n\nHowever, some companies actively try to hide unsafe conditions or have failed to report hospitalizations. In one instance, a manufacturer even blocked investigators from entering a building by parking forklifts in front of it.\n\nTo combat this, OSHA has raised fines for unreported injuries from up to $1,000 to as much as $7,000, and plans to hike them further.\n\nApart from the extreme cases, most companies have been responsive. Most of the time OSHA doesn't even have to send officials to the company for changes to be implemented.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the new system is to make workplaces safer.\n\n\"[W]e know that each case reported to us under this new requirement involved a human being who went to work one day and suffered an unexpected trauma. Some, along with their co-workers and families, were changed forever,\" the \nstatement said."

  "ARTICLE": "The nation's top federal health agency urged doctors to avoid prescribing powerful opiate painkillers for patients with chronic pain, saying the risks from such drugs far outweigh the benefits for most people.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its first ever guidelines for dispensing the morphine-like, addictive drugs, such as Vicodin and OxyContin, said it took the action Tuesday to combat the nation's deadly prescription painkiller epidemic.\nThe guidelines carve out an exception for patients receiving cancer treatment or end-of-life care. When doctors determine that such drugs are necessary in other situations, the CDC advises doctors prescribe the lowest possible dose for the shortest amount of time.\n\nAbout 40 Americans die each day from overdosing on prescription painkillers, according to the CDC. In 2013, an estimated 1.9 million people abused or were dependent on prescription opiates.\n\n\"We know of no other medication routinely used for a nonfatal condition that kills patients so frequently,\" said CDC director Thomas Frieden. \"We hope to see fewer deaths from opiates. That's the bottom line. These are really dangerous medications that carry the risk of addiction and death.\"\n\nThe CDC directed the guidelines to primary care physicians, who prescribe nearly half of opiates. Doctors aren't legally obligated to follow the recommendations, which are intended for adult patients, but such directives often have influence.\n\nThe CDC hopes the guidelines will help doctors determine when to begin or continue opiates for chronic pain, which type of painkiller to choose, how long to administer the drugs and how to weigh their risks.\n\nAndrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, called the recommendations a \"game changer\" that doctors are likely to follow.\n\n\"For the first time, the federal government is communicating clearly that the widespread practice of treating common pain conditions with long-term opioids is inappropriate,\" Kolodny said. \"The CDC is making it perfectly clear that medical practice needs to change because we’re harming pain patients and fueling a public health crisis.\"\n\nAmerican Cancer Society Cancer Action Network President Chris Hansen criticized the move for disregarding the important role of pain management for cancer survivors \"who experience severe pain that limits their quality of life.\"\n\n\"Pain does not end when an individual completes treatment,\" he said in a statement. \n\n\"Most often, cancer patients deal with lasting effects from their disease or treatment including pain for a significant period of time or indefinitely.\"\n\nMany prescription opiates on the market are as addictive as heroin, and poorly control chronic pain, Frieden said. Doctors should use therapies other than opiates first, including exercise or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, he said.\n\nWhen the benefits of prescription opiates outweigh the risks, doctors should talk to patients about their treatment goals and when they will stop using the drugs. Due to a high risk of overdose, physicians should avoid prescribing opiates at the same time as benzodiazepines, such as anti-anxiety drugs Valium and Xanax. Doctors also should prescribe immediate-release opiates, rather than extended-relief tablets that are more likely to be abused.\n\nPatients with acute pain, such as that caused by an injury, usually need prescription opiates for only three days. Prescribing the drugs for more than seven days is rarely necessary, he said.\n\n\"When opiates are used, start low and go slow,\" Frieden said, meaning doctors should increase the dose of medication slowly and only when necessary. Doctors should check every three months to see if the benefits of opiates still outweigh the risks, the guidelines said.\n\nTelling patients and doctors that opiates are rarely needed for more than a few days \"will help prevent patients from getting addicted and help keep highly addictive drugs from accumulating in medicine chests,\" Kolodny said.\n\nIf patients abuse opiates, doctors should help them get treatment supported by strong medical evidence, such as the therapies buprenorphine or methadone, which block or partly block the effects of opiates.\n\nThe CDC's hard line on opiates is a major shift from conventional wisdom about relieving pain.\n\nAlthough there has never been much evidence that opiates ease chronic pain, doctors were told for decades to consider pain as a \"vital sign\" that needed to be addressed, wrote addiction medicine specialist Yngvild Olsen,  medical director of Reach Health Services in Baltimore, in an editorial in JAMA.\n\nThat advice to manage patients' pain was accompanied by \"misleading marketing of prescription opioids by manufacturers, who minimized the risks of misuse and addiction,\" Olsen wrote. The pressure to manage pain led doctors to \"miss or dismiss the presence of addiction in their patients,\" she added.\n\nPatients should ask questions if their doctors want to prescribe opiates, said Deborah Dowell, senior medical adviser in the division of unintentional injury prevention at the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Key questions to ask include: Is an opiate necessary? What are the risks? What are the benefits? How long should I take this? Are there alternatives? What we hope to accomplish by using an opiate? How will you know when we've met our goal?\n\nSen. Edward Markey, D-Mass. who has used Senate rules to block the nomination of the Food and Drug Administration chief over the agency's regulation of opioids, praised the CDC for releasing the guidance.\n\n“Just as we need rules of the road to prevent injury and death, we need strong guidelines that can help prevent abuse of and addiction to opioid painkillers,” Markey said in a statement. \n\n“While these are important measures we need prescribers to take, they are just guidelines and we need requirements to ensure all prescribers of opioid painkillers are educated in safe prescribing practices and the identification of possible substance use disorders,\" Markey said."

  "ARTICLE": "President Barack Obama trumpeted the nation's declining uninsured rate Thursday and said 20 million people have gained insurance as a result of his signature health care law as he commemorated the approaching sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObama criticized Republicans for trying to \"repeal or undermine\" the act about 60 times and said they've explained what they would replace it with \"about zero times.\"\n\n\"If they got their way, 20 million people will have their insurance taken away from them,\" Obama said.\n\nCongratulating local leaders in Wisconsin for winning a national health insurance enrollment contest, Obama acknowledged that millions more are eligible to enroll but have yet to do so. He attributed some of that to acrimony over the law, saying people haven't always known what's true and what's not.\n\nObama was introduced at the event by Brent Brown of Mosinee, Wisconsin, who said he's a Republican who never voted to elect Obama and worked to ensure he would not be president. But he said the health care law saved his life after he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and ran out of money for treatment.\n\nBrown called on Republicans to quit trying to repeal the law. \"Swallow your pride as I am doing right now,\" he said.\n\nMore than 38,000 Milwaukee-area residents have newly signed up for health coverage, out of about 51,000 uninsured people who were eligible to enroll. The city's sign-up ratio was the highest among the 20 cities competing in the president's \"Healthy Communities Challenge.\" The winning city was promised a visit by the president.\n\n\"All told, counting new folks and people renewing their coverage, you got nearly 90,000 people to sign up,\" Obama said. \"That's enough to fill Lambeau Field and still have a big tailgating party with folks outside. And those tailgaters wouldn't have to worry because Obamacare covers indigestion from too many brats.\" \nLambeau Field is the home of the NFL's Green Bay Packers.\n\nObama also faulted Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for refusing federal funding to expand Medicaid, an option given to states under the law, to help cover more people. Obama said 21,000 additional state residents would be covered \"with the stroke of his pen.\"\n\n\"He's denying Wisconsinites their ticket to health insurance and it's political,\" Obama said of Walker, who dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination last year. Walker has argued that the federal government can't be trusted to keep its funding commitment to the states.\n\nWalker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said Thursday that due to Walker's entitlement reforms, everyone in poverty is covered through Medicaid, without exposing taxpayers to potential liability. She added that the Kaiser Family Foundation says Wisconsin is the only state that didn't expand Medicaid without a gap in coverage.\n\n\"Because of our unique reforms everyone in the state of Wisconsin has access to coverage,\" she said.\n\nFor the first time, more than 9 in 10 Americans have health insurance. And the number of uninsured has dropped from about 44.8 million in 2013, the year before the health care law's big coverage expansion, to about 28.8 million, according to the latest estimates.\n\nAn improving economy has also helped boost coverage, analysts say.\n\nStill, polling continues to show that slightly more Americans view the law unfavorably than favorably. And repealing the law has been a mantra of Republicans running for federal office as critics argue that the law's mandates have increased coverage costs unnecessarily.\n\nObama is using his final year to visit communities he says have benefited from his presidency. He hailed the auto industry's rebound during a recent trip to Detroit and last week touted the economic stimulus bill on a visit to Florida. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010.\n\nAssociated Press"

Her husband had just lost his job and the couple had been kicked out of their house, forcing their family of five to move in with his parents.\n\n“It would have been the absolute wrong thing to do, to have another baby right now,” said Amy, who is 32. “So I started calling around pretty quickly.”\n\nBut she found that getting an appointment for an abortion, even in one of the country’s largest metropolitan areas, proved almost as stressful as the unwanted pregnancy. The number of abortion clinics in Texas has shrunk by half since a 2013 state law imposed new regulations that many said they found impossible to meet. When Amy called the two clinics here just after New Year’s, and a third in Dallas, the earliest available appointment was on Jan. 22.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court, in one of the most closely watched cases of the year, is considering the constitutionality of that law and whether it creates too much of a burden on women seeking an abortion.\nWith the judges apparently deeply splintered, the decision, expected in June, could affect millions of women, though the court might send the case back to lower courts to further study the impact of the clinics’ closings. Similar laws are being challenged in other states.\n\nWith no possibility that President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, will be confirmed anytime soon, the court might also split 4 to 4, which would let stand an appeals court ruling largely upholding the Texas law but would set no national precedent.\nHere in Texas, women are experiencing what it means to navigate the landscape created when roughly half of the state’s 41 abortion clinics closed, with some facing an unnervingly long wait and others traveling hundreds of miles, sometimes leaving the state, for the procedure.\nWhen Amy, who like several others interviewed asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, went to Whole Woman’s Health here for her sonogram and abortion over two days in January, she was shocked by how crowded the waiting room was and by how long she had to wait for the procedure: about five hours.\n\nBut mostly, she said, she was relieved to have gotten in at all. Her cellphone had broken a few days earlier, causing her to miss a few calls from a clinic employee trying to confirm her appointment. When Amy realized that she had missed the calls, she broke into sobs as she frantically called back.\n\n“I said, ‘I’m so sorry. Please don’t give my appointment away, because I can’t wait another month,’” she said. “I was terrified.”\n\nAnother patient at the clinic last week, Amber, 22, said that she had initially been told she would have to wait 19 days for an abortion, and that she was relieved when the clinic was able to see her in 10 days, because of a cancellation. “I didn’t want to be any further along,” she said, adding that she had become pregnant during a brief relationship with “a guy that treated me really awful.”\n\nOpponents of the law say the wait stems largely from the closing of the clinics, which they tie directly to its requirements that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at local hospitals and that all abortions take place in so-called ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nTexas lawmakers argue that the provisions were intended to improve the safety of the clinics and that despite the closings, as Texas’ solicitor general, Scott A. Keller, put it before the court, “abortion is legal and accessible in Texas.”\n\nAbortion rights advocates say the logistical hurdles for women seeking to end pregnancies include separate Texas laws requiring most women to get a sonogram at least 24 hours before an abortion, from the same doctor, and requiring all abortions past 16 weeks to be done at surgical centers.\n\nAdding the contested law, known as H.B. 2, on top of that, “it’s the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the president of Whole Woman’s Health, the lead plaintiff in the case before the Supreme Court. “Just by design, these laws were written to break down access to abortion care.”\n\nWomen in the Fort Worth area have more options than many others. Smaller cities, including Beaumont, Lubbock, Waco and Killeen, have been left without a single abortion clinic. But even for women here, and in Houston, San Antonio and Dallas, the law has left some waiting for weeks for abortions, clinic owners say, which can take an emotional toll and make the procedure more expensive and complicated.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that states cannot impose “undue burdens” on women seeking abortions, and during arguments in the Texas case, the court’s four liberal members appeared certain that the 2013 restrictions violated that standard. But some of the more conservative justices questioned whether the law was really responsible for the wave of clinic closings, and whether those that remained open could not accommodate the demand for abortions.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who most likely holds the crucial vote, raised the possibility of returning the case to the lower courts to collect more evidence, delaying a resolution.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the timing of the closings — 11 clinics, they point out, closed on the day the admitting-privileges provision took effect — is evidence enough.\n\nWhole Woman’s Health has closed its abortion clinics in Austin and Beaumont, and Ms. Miller said its clinics in Fort Worth and San Antonio would also immediately close if the law were upheld. A fifth clinic, in McAllen, on the border with Mexico, would either close or operate at “extremely limited capacity,” she said. Whole Woman’s Health has an ambulatory surgical center in San Antonio that will remain open.\n\nThe surgical center requirement has been temporarily stayed by the Supreme Court. But if the court lets the law stand, abortion providers say all but nine of the state’s remaining clinics will close because they cannot afford to meet the construction and equipment standards of surgical centers. No clinics would remain in the vast region west of San Antonio, Ms. Miller said; two have stayed open there, in El Paso, for now.\n\nAlready, abortion providers say, long drives and packed waiting rooms have become the norm, and second-trimester abortions have become more common because of the wait for an appointment.\n\nTenesha Duncan, an administrator at Southwestern Women’s Surgery Center in Dallas, said her clinic’s patient load had doubled since the new law took effect, with more patients coming from rural parts of the state and also from Houston and Austin. Demand is so high that the clinic has expanded its procedure hours to 60 from 40 a week, Ms. Duncan said, and has assigned seven employees to answer phones.\n\nCandice Russell, a 32-year-old administrative assistant from Irving, was 12 weeks along when she learned she was pregnant in 2014, she said, and she faced a wait of two and a half weeks for an abortion in Dallas or Fort Worth.\n\nInstead, Ms. Russell took out a high-interest payday loan and flew to California, where her partner lived and where she was able to get an abortion in a matter of days.\n\n“That’s what floored me — they could see me on this day or this day or this day,” she said. “It put me into this downward financial spiral that lasted a couple of months, but compared to a lot of people, I’m super privileged. I know there are tons of people that will be affected by these closures, and they’re never going to be able to fly to California.”\n\nVolunteers for the Texas Equal Access Fund, one of several groups in Texas that help women pay for abortions, said that because of the longer wait for appointments, the fund was fielding far more requests for assistance from women in their second trimester of pregnancy than it used to.\n\n“I’ve been doing intake for over 10 years and it’s just changed radically,” said Jo Wunderlich, a volunteer who talks to as many as 70 women a week who call seeking financial help. “What we’re seeing is very often women are farther along in their pregnancy, it costs more money, we run out of money and fewer women can get funding. It’s a crazy Catch-22.”\n\nMs. Miller said that particularly near the Mexican border, the clinic closings had prompted more women to try to induce abortions with herbs or the drug misoprostol, which they obtain at flea markets or across the border.\n\nStephanie, a 20-year-old student, said she had recently driven through the night to Albuquerque for an abortion 16 weeks into her pregnancy after she could not come up with the money in time to have the procedure done at a clinic in El Paso, where she lives. Because of the earlier Texas law that requires all abortions after 16 weeks to be done in surgical centers, her options were limited to the closest such center, 550 miles away in San Antonio, or a regular abortion clinic in New Mexico.\n\nAfter pawning her camera and receiving some money from groups that help women pay for abortions, she was able to arrange the appointment in Albuquerque. She sneaked out of her parents’ house at 3 a.m., met a friend with a car, and arrived at the clinic by 7. “I was really tired,” she said, “but I knew that’s what I had to do. I had to be tough and try not to fall asleep.”\n\nDr. Linda Prine, who provides abortions at a Whole Woman’s Health clinic in Las Cruces, N.M., said more than half of her patients on any given day came from Texas. Sometimes she finds them “sleeping in their cars in our parking lot before we open up in the morning.”\n\nAt the Whole Woman’s Health clinic in Fort Worth, which looks like a small house, several women waiting for abortions said they did not like the idea of having to get the procedure at a hospital-like surgical center.\n\n“Being that the situation is already overwhelming, I wouldn’t want to go to a big place,” said one woman, 19, who has a year-old daughter and asked to be identified only by her middle name, Renea. She said she had learned she was pregnant when she went to the emergency room after a fight with her boyfriend. “The environment they set here, it gives you more of a welcoming, ‘It’s O.K.’ kind of feeling.”\n\nOther patients at the clinic that weekend had driven from Lubbock, about 300 miles away, and Odessa, 320 miles away.\n\nAmy said her 13-year-old car was too shaky to travel long distances. \nHad she not lived in Arlington, about 20 minutes from the clinic, she might have been shut off from a choice she described as essential to her own and her family’s well-being.\n\n“If it was far,” she said, “I don’t think it could have happened.”"

  "ARTICLE": "Medicare beneficiaries may get dinged with higher prescription drug bills this year because more than half of covered drugs in standalone plans require them to pay a percentage of the cost rather than a flat fee, an analysis from consulting group Avalere Health says.\n\nFifty-eight percent of covered drugs in Part D drug plans in 2016 are subject to this so-called coinsurance, the Avalere analysis found. That means patients are on the hook for a percentage of the costs, which can be much higher than a traditional copay, which is flat. If a drug costs $200, instead of making a $20 copayment, they may owe 20 percent of the cost, or $40.\n\nThe percentage of drugs requiring coinsurance has climbed steadily, increasing from 35 percent in 2014 to 45 percent last year. That percentage is approaching two-thirds of all covered drugs.\n\nMore coinsurance makes beneficiaries' drug costs less predictable, said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere. It may also result in fewer affordable options if patients can't achieve any savings by substituting drugs in the same therapeutic class, she said. The shift toward coinsurance also means that Medicare beneficiaries will have to rely to a greater extent on cost-estimating tools like the Medicare plan finder to figure out how much they may owe out of pocket.\n\nMedicare Part D plans typically divide drugs into five tiers with different levels of cost sharing. In the past, coinsurance may have been limited to high-cost specialty drugs, but that's changing. Last year, about two-thirds of people in drug plans faced coinsurance in more than one drug tier; this year the figure is 96 percent, according to Avalere.\n\nMedicare Advantage managed care plans aren't shifting to coinsurance to the same degree as the standalone drugs plans that accompany traditional Medicare coverage, the analysis found. In 2016, 26 percent of covered drugs in Medicare Advantage plans required coinsurance.\n\n\"On the Medicare Advantage side, the premium includes both medical and drug benefits, and the drug piece is smaller,\" so the incentive to tightly manage drug costs may be lower in Medicare Advantage plans, Pearson said."

  "ARTICLE": "California's insurance exchange is threatening to cut hospitals from its networks for poor performance or high costs, a novel proposal that is drawing heavy fire from medical providers and insurers.\n\nThe goal is to boost the overall quality of patient care and make coverage more affordable, said Peter Lee, executive director of the Covered California exchange.\n\n\"The first few years were about getting people in the door for coverage,\" said Lee, a key figure in the rollout of the federal health law. \"We are now shifting our attention to changing the underlying delivery system to make it more cost effective and higher quality. We don't want to throw anyone out, but we don't want to pay for bad quality care either.\"\n\nIt appears to be the first proposal of its kind in the country. The exchange's five-member board is slated to vote on it next month. If approved, insurers would need to identify hospital \"outliers\" on cost and quality starting in 2018. Medical groups and doctors would be rated after that.\n\nProviders who don't measure up stand to lose insured patients and suffer a black eye that could sully their reputations with employers and other big customers.\n\nBy 2019, health plans would be expected to expel poor performers from their exchange networks.\n\nThe idea has already sparked fierce opposition. Doctors and hospitals accuse the exchange of overstepping its authority and failing to spell out the specific measures they would be judged on.\n\nHealth insurers, normally at odds with providers, have joined them in the fight. The insurers are balking at the prospect of disclosing their negotiated rates with providers. Health plans have long resisted efforts that would let competitors or the public see the deals they make with doctors and hospitals.\n\nBut scrutinizing the negotiated rates would help the exchange identify high-cost providers and allow policyholders with high deductibles to see the differences in price before undergoing a surgery or imaging test.\n\nLee said it's time for the exchange to move beyond enrollment and flex its market power on behalf of its 1.5 million members. He said insurers haven't been tough enough on hospitals and doctors.\n\nOther public exchanges or large employers could try to replicate the idea, putting more pressure on providers and insurers. Lee has shared his proposal with other state marketplaces, government officials and employer groups to promote similar efforts.\n\nStill, there are limits to this strategy. Exceptions would be granted if excluding a hospital or doctor from a network meant an area wouldn't have a sufficient number of providers. Insurers could appeal and offer other reasons for keeping a provider in the network.\n\n\"California is definitely ahead of the pack when it comes to taking an active purchasing role, and exclusion is a pretty big threat,\" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. \"There may be a dominant hospital system that's charging through the nose, but without them you don't have an adequate network. It will be interesting to see how Covered California threads that needle.\"\n\nThe composition of networks has typically been left up to insurers. Until now, most of the discussion has centered on the proliferation of narrow networks, with a limited range of providers, sold under the Affordable Care Act as a way to hold down rates. A study in 2015 found that 75 percent of Covered California plans had narrow physician networks, with more restricted choices than all but three other states.\n\n\"I don't know of anyone even close to trying this,\" said Dan Polsky, the study's author and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. \"I applaud Covered California for being bold to improve quality and reduce costs, but I worry about the implementation.\"\n\nPolsky said measuring quality can be complicated, and steps must be taken to ensure hospitals and doctors aren't penalized for treating sicker patients or serving lower-income areas. Most quality-boosting efforts use financial bonuses and penalties rather than exclusion.\n\nUnder the Covered California plan, hospitals would be judged on a wide range of performance and safety measures, from rates of readmission and hospital-acquired infections to adverse drug events. The exchange said it will draw on existing measures already tracked by Medicare and other groups, and it will work with hospitals, consumer advocates and other experts over the next 18 months to finalize the details.\n\nThe California Hospital Association said the exchange is moving too fast and acting too much like a regulator.\n\n\"The devil is in the details, and the rapidity of this concerns us,\" said Dr. David Perrott, chief medical officer at the state hospital trade group. \"We understand value-based purchasing is here in some form and we do not oppose that. But Covered California is charging ahead with this assessment and trying to figure out the answers when it hasn't been worked out.\"\n\nCalifornia physicians warn that the exchange's proposal could further reduce networks that are already too thin for patients.\n\n\"Right now, one of the biggest problems in health care is limited access to specialty care. This allows more narrowing of the networks under spurious guidelines,\" said Dr. Ted Mazer, a board member of the California Medical Association and a head and neck surgeon in San Diego.\n\nCharles Bacchi, chief executive of the California Association of Health Plans, predicted that Covered California's idea will backfire, discouraging hospitals and doctors from participating in the exchange and driving up premiums as a result.\n\n\"It's the right goal but the wrong approach,\" Bacchi said. \"Covered California is proposing a top-down, arbitrary measurement system that carries a big stick. This can make it difficult for health plans and providers to work together constructively."

   "ARTICLE": "North Korea has sentenced an American college student to 15 years’ hard labour after finding him guilty of “crimes against the state”, in a ruling that is certain to increase tensions with Washington.\n\nOtto Warmbier, a 21-year-old economics student at the University of Virginia, was found guilty of committing “severe crimes” against the North Korean state after he was held for allegedly attempting to steal a political banner from a restricted area of the hotel where he was staying in the capital Pyongyang.\n\nWarmbier’s conviction by the North’s supreme court, announced on Wednesday by China’s Xinhua news agency, comes soon after the UN security council agreed a new round of sanctions in response to the regime’s recent nuclear test and rocket launch. The White House also announced a fresh round of sanctions on North Korea in response to those same incidents on Wednesday.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation of the trial, which reportedly lasted less than an hour, by the North Korean state media. \n\nCalling Warmbier’s detention “completely unjustified”, Republican presidential candidate John Kasich, governor of Warmbier’s home state of Ohio, called on North Korea to “immediately release Otto Warmbier and let him return to his family here in Ohio”.\n\n“His detention was completely unjustified and the sentence North Korea imposed on him is an affront to the concepts of justice. Continuing to hold him only further alienates the international community.” Kasich repeated his calls for the Obama administration to “redouble its efforts” to secure Warmbier’s release.\n\nLater on Wednesday, the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, urged North Korea to show leniency for the 21-year-old student.\n\n“We strongly encourage the North Korean government to pardon him and grant him special amnesty and immediate release.”\n\nTensions on the Korean peninsula have risen in recent weeks following the start of the largest-ever joint military exercises involving South Korea and the US. In response, Pyongyang has kept up a daily barrage of threats to carry out nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington over the drills, which the North regards as a rehearsal for an invasion.\n\nEarlier this week the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, warned that the country was about to carry out tests of another nuclear warhead, as well as ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear bombs to the US and other targets.\n\nWhile there is some disagreement over how advanced North Korea’s nuclear programme is, US officials believe North Korea is some way off being able to mount a nuclear warhead and deliver it to a target as far away as the mainland US.\n\n“We have not seen North Korea demonstrate capability to miniaturise a nuclear weapon, and again, put it on a ballistic missile,” the Pentagon spokesman, Peter Cook, told reporters.\n\nIn the past, the regime has used detainees as leverage to secure visits by high-profile US politicians, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe US accused North Korea of using Warmbier for propaganda purposes after he made a stage-managed confession in late February.\n\nIn a prepared statement read out before TV cameras, Warmbier said a member of Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming, Ohio, described as the mother of a friend, had offered him a used car worth $10,000 if he could return with the banner as a “trophy” from North Korea.\n\nChurch officials said they did not know the woman identified by Warmbier, adding that he was not a member of the congregation.\n\nWarmbier broke down in tears as he acknowledged and apologised for his alleged crime, which he described as “the worst mistake of my life”.\n\nAnalysis Wh​o else has North Korea locked up for 'crimes against the state'?\nAs student Otto Warmbier joins two westerners currently detained in the DPRK, we look at the other victims of Pyongyang’s erratic detention system\n Read more\nWarmbier was arrested in early January, as he was about to board a flight from Pyongyang for Beijing at the end of a visit arranged by Young Pioneer Tours, an agency specialising in travel to North Korea.\n\nOn its website, the US State Department strongly discourages all travel to North Korea, with which Washington does not have diplomatic relations, and warns of the “risk of arrest and long-term detention”.\n\nWarmbier’s parents pleaded with the North to show leniency, citing his youth and the fact that he had made a full confession in public.\n\nBill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, who had previously travelled to North Korea, met Pyongyang’s ambassador to the UN on Tuesday to press for Warmbier’s release, the New York Times reported.\n\n“I urged the humanitarian release of Otto, and they agreed to convey our request,” Richardson told the newspaper.\n\nNorth Korea last year sentenced Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim to life imprisonment with hard labour on sedition charges."

   "ARTICLE": "Thousands of desperate refugees who had made a dramatic push into Macedonia – bypassing its sealed border by wading through the freezing waters of a river – were forcibly returned to Greece on Tuesday amid heightened tensions between the two countries.\n\nAs Athens and Skopje engaged in a war of words over the episode, hundreds of exhausted men, women and children began streaming back into the muddy, waterlogged camp they had sought to flee barely 24 hours earlier.\n\n“They hit everyone – women, children, men – and said ‘you are going back’,” said Halad al-Hassan, 32, from Raqqa, the Syrian city overrun by Islamic State militants last summer. “People are very shocked, too shocked to even want to speak,” he sighed, shaking his head in disbelief. “I’ve been here in Idomeni for 27 days. It’s very bad, very cold, very unbelievable. Why does Macedonia do this? Why has Europe closed the borders?”\n\nDazed youngsters, blankets strewn across their shoulders against the biting cold, walked around aimlessly as charity workers – many having worked through the night – strove to cater for the estimated 2,500 people pushed back into Greece.\n\nSyria's civil war: five years of Guardian reporting\n Read more\nSave the Children described how Macedonian authorities began sending people back in trucks, dropping children off shivering, wet and disorientated.\n\n“Some people collapsed by the roadside and needed medical attention on the tarmac and those that made it back to the camp faced a night out in the open, with rain starting to fall around 4.30am,” the organisation said. “Up to 600 people remained stuck in the other side of the river.”\n\nThe abortive “march of hope” appears to have been triggered not only by conditions in the camp that have deteriorated by the day but an Arabic-language leaflet encouraging refugees to take fate into their own hands.\n\nThe document, purportedly distributed by activists on Monday, provided a map and instructions on how best to breach the border, crucially delineating a dry river bed despite heavy rain in the region for the past two weeks. Three Afghan migrants drowned attempting to cross the fast-flowing waters earlier in the day.\n\nWith diplomatic tensions on the rise, rumour was rife on Tuesday that German anarchists operating in the camp had been behind the flyer. Bild, Germany’s mass-selling newspaper, pointed out that it was signed Kommando Norbet Blüm after the country’s former labour minister. The octogenarian Blüm spent a night last week in Idomeni, camping out in solidarity with the refugees.\n\nAid groups insisted that a growing sense of desperation – matched by the increasingly deplorable conditions of a tent city that houses up to 14,000 people and stretches across several fields – was to blame for the show of defiance. Many people have been left stranded at the camp for almost a month since Macedonia shut the frontier in response to similar moves by other Balkan and eastern European countries farther up the migrant trail.\n\n“Such is the hardship here that it gave them some sort of hope,” said Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency at the camp. “If all legal routes are blocked, as they are with the closure of borders, it allows other elements to exploit the situation and thrive,” he said, referring to people smugglers promising alternative routes to freedom who have flocked to Idomeni. “Conditions in this place are not fit for humans.”\n\n\nThe stories you need to read, in one handy email\n Read more\nVisiting the camp on Tuesday, the European Union’s top migration official, Dimitris Avramopoulos, urged refugees to ignore ruthless smugglers, saying: “By following the legal path, they will be able, one day, to live under better conditions.”\n\nHe said it was urgent that the EU immediately implemented plans that had been previously agreed to relocate refugees. “I would like from Idomeni to send a message to Europe for everyone to show solidarity … all our values are in danger and you can see it here.”\n\nDenouncing the decision of some states to erect barbed-wire fences across their borders, he told reporters: “We have a migration policy, an action plan against smugglers, and I call on all member states to start implementing [it]. Our target is, and will be, to relocate 6,000 people a month in cooperation with Turkey, which is very important, a major stakeholder.”"

   "ARTICLE": "A Chinese university professor at the centre of a row over free speech has spoken out again about growing censorship.\n\nLast week internet censors purged an interview given to a leading Chinese magazine by Jiang Hong, a government adviser and academic. The magazine, Caixin, subsequently challenged the government over the incident, in a rare rebuke to the Communist party’s attempts to control the media.\n\nDays later an employee at China’s news and propaganda agency Xinhua criticised censors’ “crude” and “extreme” violations of online freedom of expression. Growing suppression of free speech “has triggered tremendous fear and outrage among the public”, the journalist Zhou Fang claimed in an open letter that was circulated online before itself being deleted by censors.\n\nJiang, who last week lamented China’s “terrible and bewildering” censorship, continued to speak out against the government’s attempts to control public discourse. In an interview with the BBC, the academic said he was alarmed by a surge in the number of online articles and blogs being deleted.\n\n“If a society only listens to one voice, then mistakes can be made,” Jiang said on the sidelines of China’s annual parliament, the National People’s Congress, which concluded on Wednesday. “A good way to prevent this from happening is to let everyone speak up, to give us the whole picture.”\n\nThe recent rise in censorship had “made people worried about expressing their opinions”, added Jiang, who teaches at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.\n\nThe free speech row comes as China swings back towards what some political observers describe as a “hard authoritarian” model of governance in which dissent is stifled.\n\nSince Xi Jinping became Communist party chief in late 2012, human rights lawyers, bloggers, feminists, journalists, academics and, most recently, labour activists have all been targeted in what appears to be a coordinated attempt to silence criticism. \n\nMany observers believe Beijing’s determination to bring its opponents to heel reflects growing concern among the leadership about the state of the Chinese economy.\n\nOn Wednesday the prime minister, Li Keqiang, admitted his government was grappling with “deep-seated” economic problems but expressed optimism about China’s longer-term prospects.\n\n“We have full confidence in the bright future of China’s economy. Our confidence is not built on flimsy ground. We feel so confident because we believe that as long as we stay on the course of reform and opening up, China’s economy will not suffer a hard landing,” Li said at a highly choreographed two-hour press conference at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. \n\n“There are both difficulties and hopes for China’s economy but … there are more hopes than difficulties,” Li added. \n\nHowever, there are mounting concerns about the potential for unrest as the economy loses steam after years of double-digit growth, and the number of strikes balloons. \n\nLast weekend thousands of miners poured on to the streets in China’s north-eastern rust belt to protest against unpaid wages, some holding placards that read: “We want to live, we want to eat.”\n\nJiang, the outspoken government adviser, said he was troubled that as a result of censorship he was unable to express his concerns over free speech to the Chinese public. “In this aspect, there’s still a lot of improvement needed in our country,” he told the BBC."

   "ARTICLE": "The government has said it has no plans to deploy British troops to provide security for Libya’s newly-appointed national unity government.\n\nThe denial came in response to a letter to the foreign secretary from Crispin Blunt MP, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, seeking a statement to parliament in advance of any military action.\n\nBlunt had argued that the first formal move of a new Libyan government was likely to be to ask Britain and its allies to conduct airstrikes against Islamic State targets in the country, according to Blunt.\n\nIsis, with strongholds in Syria and Iraq, has expanded its presence in Libya, taking over the town of Sirte and other areas, taking advantage of the absence of a government and of increasing unrest.\n\n\nThe stories you need to read, in one handy email\n Read more\nBlunt said that the reported deployment of UK troops as part of an Italian-led force to Libya would be a matter for the Commons and Hammond should make a statement before defence secretary Michael Fallon agreed to such a deployment.\n\nFallon on Tuesday held a telephone conference with the defence ministers of Italy, France, Spain and Germany about the combined force.\n\nThe 5,000-strong force – though Blunt puts it at 6,000 – would be sent to train and advise the new Libyan army. Although all five countries insist the role would not be a combat one, there is always a risk of mission creep. The Libyan government might need to be bolstered in the event of an attack or the international force might be targeted by Isis.\n\nThe Italian government is trying to build as wide a coalition as possible so if more countries were to send troops the UK contribution could end up as fewer than 1,000.\n\nBut a government spokesperson issued an unusually strong denial: “What members of the foreign affairs committee heard on their recent visit is wrong on a number of counts. There are no plans to extend airstrikes to Libya nor are there plans to send British troops to provide security on the ground in Libya. It is therefore also wrong to suggest the defence secretary will agree any UK contribution this week.”\n\nBlunt, who last week visited Tunisia and Egypt with the rest of the committee, said the formation of a new Libyan government – the government of national accord – was announced on Saturday and “we heard that the GNA’s likely first formal action will be to request that the UK and its allies conduct airstrikes against Isil [Isis] targets in Libya”.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence says it has no such plans for airstrikes, though it insists it has the capability in spite of already being in action in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe US is already conducting sporadic airstrikes against Isis in Libya.\n\nIn his letter, Blunt said the international force of which the UK would be part will be deployed in the near future and the committee had heard it will have two objectives: to train the Libyan army and provide security for the new government in Tripoli.\n\n“The pre-emptive deployment of UK military forces is now a matter for the House of Commons. I, therefore, request that you make a statement to the House on the state of the plan of for any deployment of UK military forces in Libya before the defence secretary agrees the UK component of any international force and explain how this deployment is consistent with our policy objectives,” Blunt wrote.\n\nThe Italian-led force requires first a formal invitation from the new government. Ministers from the Libyan unity government are expected to establish an office in Tripoli in the coming days, but their arrival is likely to be contested and could trigger fresh violence in the capital.\n\nWestern capitals predict the new government will give a green light to a future military training programme for a new Libyan army and back the US-led airstrikes against Isis militants already under way.\n\nThe list of proposed ministers has yet to receive a vote of approval from the House of Representatives (HoR), a UN-backed assembly in Tobruk, as had been envisaged in a political settlement agreed in Morocco in December. But western diplomats say the volatile and often violent nature of Libyan politics meant that many HoR members were not able to cast their votes. Instead, the presidency council chose to interpret the endorsement of about 100 HoR members as a “green light” to proclaim the new government.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the government will have no real legitimacy without moving to Tripoli, the seat of most state institutions, but that will not be easy. It is opposed by the leadership of the Islamist-dominated general national congress (GNC) and at least one hardline militia, the Samood Front. Even members of the negotiating group that produced the December agreement have voiced doubts on its legitimacy without a formal HoR vote.\n\nHowever, negotiations are under way this week with other Tripoli militias prepared to accept the new government, if only because its arrival would resume the flow of foreign funds into the Libyan capital. Those talks are hoped to clear the way for the quiet arrival of at least some of the new ministers, including the prime minister designate and the head of the presidency council, Fayez al-Sarraj. That would establish at least a symbolic presence that the UN, US and Europe hope will bring the support of other power-brokers in Libya’s chaotic political and military landscape.\n\nHowever, it is expected that the Samood Front, Isis and other hardline Islamists in Tripoli would seek to target the ministers, triggering a flareup of violence in the capital. The ministers would have to stay for the immediate future in a single heavily guarded location."

   "ARTICLE": "Myanmar’s parliament has elected Htin Kyaw as the country’s first non-military president since the army took power in a 1962 coup.\n\nA close adviser and loyal friend to Aung San Suu Kyi, the 69-year-old was nominated by the National League for Democracy party last week and voted into the presidency by parliament on Tuesday.\nSuu Kyi, who is barred from the presidency under an army-drafted constitution, has made clear she will be “above the president” and Htin Kyaw is expected to act as a proxy.\n\nReporters in the capital, Naypyidaw, were not allowed to enter the parliament chamber when the voting took place.\n\nA final tally giving Htin Kyaw 360 out of 652 votes was met with applause. The two runners up, military nominee Myint Swe and ethnic minority Chin candidate Henry Van Thio, will become first and second vice-presidents respectively.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi, herself a member of parliament, cast her vote and later smiled broadly and clapped when the results were announced.\n\nThe parliament chamber was mostly a light orange, the colour of the NLD majority who wore Burmese longyi skirts and traditional hats. Also present were members of ethnic parties and military representatives.\n\nMyanmar held elections in November, with the NLD winning a majority in both houses of parliament.\n\nSuu Kyi’s majority allowed her to effectively handpick a successor to the current president, Thein Sein, a former general who implemented reforms in 2011 moving the country away from dictatorship.\n\nAlthough Thein Sein retired from the army to take office, the 2010 elections that preceded his appointment were widely dismissed as fraudulent and his political party is a military creation.\n\n\nHtin Kyaw was elected under a complex system in which the two chambers of parliament nominated two presidential candidates and military MPs nominated a third, assuring the army continued influence.\n\nThe army also retains 25% of seats in parliament under a 2008 constitution that it drafted, giving it an effective veto on constitutional change. It also keeps key ministerial portfolios related to security.\n\nMyint Swe, 64, the military’s nominee, is a hardline conservative blacklisted by the US. He is a close ally to former junta leader Than Shwe and has been criticised for dealing harshly with opposition activists under military rule.\n\nUS State Department spokesman John Kirby said at a briefing on Friday in Washington that he had no indication Myint Swe would be taken off the sanctions list.\n\n\nMyanmar’s moment of truth\n Read more\n“We have made our concerns known about this individual and this process, quite frankly, and we’ll monitor it going forward,” he told reporters.\n\nHtin Kyaw, however, comes from the other side of Myanmar’s long history of oppression under military rule. He went to school in Yangon alongside Aung San Suu Kyi before winning a scholarship to study at university in the UK, and spent four months in jail in 2000 after trying to help the NLD leader travel outside Yangon.\n\nHtin Kyaw is also a senior executive at a charitable foundation named after Aung San Suu Kyi’s mother. He is the son of Min Thu Wun, a respected author and poet.\n\nThant Myint-U, a historian and the grandson of the former UN secretary general U Thant, has said Htin Kyaw is “from a family that’s been at the heart of Burma’s [long submerged] liberal tradition for nearly a century”.\n\nThe constitution prevents the top job from going to anyone with foreign children. Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent 15 of 21 years under house arrest, has two British sons.\n\nIn a sign of the mandate that Suu Kyi commands in this parliament, the final count suggested that 54 independent and ethnic party members voted for the NLD candidate.\n\nMyint Swe received 213 votes and Henry Van Thio took 79 votes.\n\nNLD spokesman Win Htein said this month that Aung San Suu Kyi still planned to become the president – “it just depends on whether it is earlier or later”."

   "ARTICLE": "George Osborne is facing a potential rebellion over the “tampon tax” next week, from an alliance of feminists and campaigners for Britain to leave the European Union.\n\nLabour backbencher Paula Sherriff, who has waged a campaign against the 5% VAT charged on sanitary products, has laid an amendment to the budget resolution enacting the chancellor’s tax plans. If implemented, it would allow MPs to strike down the tampon tax when the finance bill is debated later this month.\n\nSherriff has won the support of Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers, who resent the fact that Brussels rules prevent Britain from altering the scope of VAT.\n\nConservative Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU after the referendum on 23 June, said: “The people we elect should be responsible for setting the taxes in this country – not unelected EU judges and bureaucrats. It is a fundamental principle of democracy that there should be no taxation without representation, which is what we now have.”\n“Our chancellor is unable to take this decision that will benefit women because VAT is controlled by the EU. The only way to get this change is to Vote Leave on 23 June.”\n\nSherriff, the MP for Dewsbury since last year’s general election, said: “I genuinely feel really passionate about this. It’s a tax on women. The fact that tampons are taxed at 5% suggests they’re a luxury item. I can’t think of anything less luxurious.”\n\nOsborne sought to assuage backbenchers’ anger over the tax in his autumn statement in November by allocating the £15m of revenue raised to a series of charities that benefit women. In his budget speech he said £12m had already been set aside to causes including Breast Cancer Care.\n\nBut Eurosceptic backbenchers, of whom there are more than 100, could decide to make trouble for the chancellor by supporting the amendment.\n\nThe scale of unrest on Conservative backbenchers was underlined last week when the government suffered an embarrassing defeat over plans to liberalise Sunday trading rules, which had been spearheaded by the chancellor.\n\nSherriff insisted she would not rest until sanitary products are zero-rated for VAT. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, will decide whether to accept the amendment, which could be the subject of a vote on 22 March.\n\nLabour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Seema Malhotra, has pointed to leaked documents suggesting the European commission is considering proposals that would hand back powers to the chancellor, allowing him to abolish the tax. Sherriff called on him to prioritise the issue in negotiations with Brussels.\n\nAlison Thewliss, the SNP MP for Glasgow Central and another member of the 2015 intake, is another supporter of the amendment.\n\nLeave campaigners have sought to win over feminists to their cause, with Eurosceptic employment minister Priti Patel even comparing those urging a no vote in June’s referendum with the suffragettes who fought for women to be given the vote."

   "SUMMARY": "The president, in nominating Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, described the appeals court judge as “one of America’s sharpest legal minds.”",
   "IMAGE_LINK": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Merrick_Garland_ap_img.jpg",
   "ARTICLE": "President Obama on Wednesday nominated Merrick B. Garland to be the nation’s 113th Supreme Court justice, choosing a centrist appellate judge who could reshape the court for a generation and become the face of a bitter election-year confirmation struggle.\n\nIn selecting Judge Garland, 63, a well-known figure in Washington legal circles who has drawn praise from members of both parties, Mr. Obama dared Republican senators to ignore public pressure and make good on their promise to block consideration of any nominee until after the next president is chosen.\n\nThe nomination to fill the seat on the court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia sets in motion a standoff that is likely to play out for many months, perhaps without resolution. Its outcome could tip the ideological balance of the nation’s highest court, and an array of well-financed interest groups on both sides has already assembled for the battle over the nomination.\n\n“I’ve selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of America’s sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency, modesty, integrity, even-handedness, and excellence,” Mr. Obama said in a formal Rose Garden ceremony announcing his selection, where the president was flanked by Judge Garland and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their term; neither should a senator.”\n\nRepublicans quickly rejected Mr. Obama’s challenge. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, appeared on the Senate floor shortly after the president’s remarks to declare an end to Judge Garland’s nomination, no matter his qualifications. In case there was any doubt, Mr. McConnell later called Judge Garland personally to say he would not be receiving him in his Capitol office, nor taking any action on his nomination.\n\n“The American people may well elect a president who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “The next president may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy.”\n\nIn choosing Judge Garland, a former prosecutor who has served on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997 and as its chief judge since 2013, Mr. Obama opted to select a jurist better known for his meticulous work ethic and adherence to legal principles than for an ideological bent.\n\n“At a time when our politics are so polarized, at a time when norms and customs of political rhetoric and courtesy and comity are so often treated like they’re disposable, this is precisely the time when we should play it straight,” Mr. Obama told an audience that included Judge Garland’s family, Democratic senators and liberal activists. White House officials considered, and rejected, advice from supporters who urged Mr. Obama to pressure Republicans by nominating a member of a racial minority. They also declined to zero in on a liberal champion who might have excited the core Democratic supporters that Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders would need in the general election.\n\nSome liberals expressed dismay with that decision. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy in America, said it was “deeply disappointing that President Obama failed to use this opportunity to add the voice of another progressive woman of color to the Supreme Court, and instead put forward a nominee seemingly designed to appease intransigent Republicans.”\n\nBut White House officials said that Mr. Obama and his aides made the calculation that focusing on finding a nominee with impeccable legal credentials would expose the Republican opposition as based solely on politics. The president passed over two other federal appellate judges on his short list who might have achieved those goals: Sri Srinivasan, 49, of Indian descent, and Paul Watford, 48, an African-American who is viewed as more liberal than Judge Garland.\n\n“To suggest that someone as qualified and respected as Merrick Garland doesn’t even deserve a hearing, let alone an up-or-down vote, to join an institution as important as our Supreme Court, when two-thirds of Americans believe otherwise — that would be unprecedented,” the president said.\n\nMr. Obama had twice considered Judge Garland for the Supreme Court during his first term, and some aides viewed him at the time as an “in-case-of-emergency-break-glass” candidate whom they should save for a future vacancy where they needed a nominee who was broadly acceptable to Republicans. That future appears to have arrived.\n\nA few Senate Republicans have suggested recently that if Mrs. Clinton is elected in November, they might be more open to considering Judge Garland as an alternative to a more liberal nominee. And as Judge Garland prepared to begin meeting with senators on Thursday, there was early evidence that at least some Republican senators were softening their stances.\n\nA White House statement said that Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had agreed to meet with Judge Garland, but that the meeting would be scheduled after the two-week congressional recess ended. Senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, both facing steep re-election challenges in Democratic-leaning states, said they would meet with Judge Garland.\n\nSenators Susan M. Collins and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both Republicans, have also said they would sit down with Mr. Obama’s nominee. And Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said he would be open to holding hearings on Judge Garland during a lame-duck congressional session after the election.\n\nThe White House reached out to Judge Garland, along with a number of other potential nominees, days after Justice Scalia’s death on Feb. 13. Mr. Obama interviewed him last Thursday even as the president’s short list, which included his name and those of Judges Srinivasan and Watford, leaked in the news media, alarming the West Wing officials who were trying to keep the process out of the spotlight.\n\nMr. Obama spent Friday and Saturday in Texas, attending the South by Southwest festival and Democratic fund-raisers before playing a round of golf. He returned to Washington late Saturday night and informed his top aides soon afterward that Judge Garland would be his pick.\n\nDenis McDonough, the president’s chief of staff, was one of only about a half-dozen top aides who knew the choice as planning for the public rollout of the nominee kicked into gear. Much of the work could be prepared without knowing the specific nominee, but on Tuesday night, White House videographers recorded Judge Garland for the gauzy biographical video that they released Wednesday morning.\n\nIt came out just after Mr. Obama appeared under a sunny sky at the Rose Garden to introduce Judge Garland and urge Republicans to give him a chance.\n \nGraphic: Supreme Court Nominees Considered in Election Years Are Usually Confirmed\n“I simply ask Republicans in the Senate to give him a fair hearing, and then an up-or-down vote,” Mr. Obama said. “If you don’t, then it will not only be an abdication of the Senate’s constitutional duty, it will indicate a process for nominating and confirming judges that is beyond repair.”\n\nJudge Garland’s professional life was shaped in part by the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, which killed 168 people. As a Justice Department official in the Clinton administration, he coordinated the government’s response, starting the case against the two men charged, Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and eventually supervising their prosecution. Mr. McVeigh was executed.\n\nJudge Garland insisted on going to the scene even as bodies were being pulled from the rubble, friends said. His role captivated Mr. Obama, said Valerie Jarrett, the president’s senior adviser, who added that it “struck the president because it reflects on the chief judge’s character.”\n\nIn his brief remarks, Judge Garland emotionally described his career as a prosecutor and a judge, saying that “fidelity to the Constitution and the law have been the cornerstone of my professional life.” He said that if the Senate confirmed him, he promised to “continue on that course.”\n\nThe scene captured an extraordinary moment of uncertainty for Judge Garland, twice passed over for the Supreme Court and now facing a path to confirmation that is, at best, ambiguous — and could be a dead end entirely.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and a member of the Judiciary panel who attended the ceremony, said that may have helped move Judge Garland to the verge of tears during his comments.\n\n“This is about how this burden of standing up for an independent judiciary — even if you may never get confirmed — is so important in this incredibly polarized time,” Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview.\n\nShe said many Republicans who had opposed Mr. Obama’s earlier, successfully confirmed Supreme Court nominees, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, had told her during those proceedings that they would have supported the president if he had selected Judge Garland instead.\n\n“It’s kind of hard to get away from the fact that he, in the past and now, has been viewed as a consensus person,” she added."

   "ARTICLE": "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are conducting a sweeping investigation of environmental health and safety conditions, including cases of elevated blood lead levels, in public housing and homeless shelters and the possibility that the New York City housing and homeless agencies filed false claims to federal housing officials for payment related to the conditions.\n\nThe investigation was disclosed on Wednesday in a letter from the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and in a judge’s subsequent order, which were both filed in federal court.\n\nThe order, from Judge Deborah A. Batts, compels the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to produce information about the cases of elevated blood lead levels among residents and complaints of “unsafe, unsanitary or unhealthful conditions” in public housing and homeless shelters.\n\nThe documents said the health agency, in response to an earlier civil investigative demand from the prosecutors, had declined to provide the information without a judge’s order, to avoid violating the city and state health codes.\n\nNick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city’s Law Department, said late Wednesday that the health department was “cooperating with the investigation.”\n\nThe Housing Authority, known as Nycha, has been struggling with deteriorating conditions in its aging complexes and is already under the supervision of a court-appointed special master to address issues of mold among the 178,000 apartments it manages.\n\nThe agency has blamed a lack of money to address maintenance needs and major capital projects because of deep cuts in federal funding over more than a decade.\n\nBut the court documents noted that Nycha is required to comply with federal requirements regarding lead-based paint and to maintain public housing “so that it is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair.” The investigative demand said the investigation “concerns possible false claims” submitted by the city to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is a major source of funds for the Housing Authority.\n\nThe prosecutors’ initial demand for documents, dated Nov. 20, sought the addresses of all buildings of the Housing Authority and the Department of Homeless Services where people with elevated blood lead levels had been identified; the date when those people’s elevated blood lead levels were identified; the date of any environmental investigation; the date the results of any such investigation were sent to the agencies; and the date the property in question was cleared, if lead hazard control was required by local law.\n\nProsecutors also sought any notification letters and lead-based-paint evaluation results regarding the relevant people, properties and incidents. They also sought documents reflecting complaints about health conditions in public housing and homeless shelters, including those about “leaks, water damage, mold, particulate matter peeling paint in pre-1978 buildings, lead paint, rodents or insects, and all documents reflecting any response to, investigation of or evaluation of such complaints” by any city or state official or agency.\n\nThe initial demand also sought all communications between the city’s health, homeless and housing agencies, or any city, state or federal agency, about problematic health conditions in city public housing or homeless shelters. Prosecutors also sought documents reflecting any city or state analysis of the health effects of lead, mold, particulate matter, rodents or insects on residents of city public housing or homeless shelters.\n\nAsked about the investigation on Wednesday night, during an appearance at a panel discussion at Cooper Union titled “The Next 100 Years of Affordable Housing,” the Housing Authority chairwoman and chief executive, Shola Olatoye, said she had no comment. Referring to herself and Mayor Bill de Blasio, she said, “What we all care about is having a safe and healthy community.”\n\nThe public housing stock of red brick towers dates as far back as the 1930s and 1940s — with many still likely to contain lead paint — and the agency has struggled to keep up with a backlog of work orders, including for lead paint removal.\n\nThis month, State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, and Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from the Bronx who is chairman of the City Council’s Public Housing Committee, released the results of a door-to-door survey their offices conducted among more than 200 Nycha residents, with 63 percent of those surveyed reporting something damaged or broken in their unit.\n\nThe officials said staff members took pictures in common areas of “egregious” violations, like electrical wiring, mold and peeling paint.\n\nMr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has committed $300 million over three years for roof repairs, which officials said would help deal with the root cause of mold and excessive moisture.\n\nMr. Torres said he was surprised by the inquiry into possible false claims, but not by the concerns about health, given what he said was the agency’s “dubious” record addressing hazards.\n\nHe said the agency was “both poorly funded and poorly managed” and should be doing better with the funds it gets.\n\n“When you’re under investigation by Preet Bharara,” Mr. Torres said, “that’s as serious as it gets.”"

   "ARTICLE": "After months squaring off against Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, presuming him to be the chief obstacle to a one-on-one showdown with Donald J. Trump, Senator Ted Cruz on Wednesday emerged from the latest Republican primaries with a new foe who was actually there all along: Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.\n\nThe transition seemed a bit jarring for all involved. The men had scarcely said a cross word about each other before Tuesday night’s contests.\n\nThere had been little need. While Mr. Cruz, of Texas, has moved to consolidate support among evangelical and Tea Party voters, Mr. Kasich has made a play for party moderates, outlasting establishment rivals like Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Mr. Rubio, who dropped out Tuesday after losing his home state.\n\nNow, it seems, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich will get to know each other a bit better. And their opening gambits were to argue that the other has no chance of becoming president .\n\n“There are only two people who actually have a viable path to the nomination,” Jason Johnson, Mr. Cruz’s chief strategist, told reporters. “There’s one spoiler in the race: John Kasich.”\n\nMr. Johnson likened Mr. Kasich’s run to some quixotic ambitions of his own. “It’s like my dream of making the senior tour on the P.G.A. or my dream of being a Nascar driver,” he said. “It ain’t going to happen.”\n\nJohn Kasich after a town-hall meeting at Villanova University on Wednesday. Credit Dominick Reuter/Reuters\nMr. Kasich countered on Wednesday by suggesting that Mr. Cruz, along with Mr. Trump, was too extreme to attract wide support in the fall.\n\n“Neither of those guys can win a general election,” he told reporters after a town hall-style event outside Philadelphia. “So maybe they’re spoiling it for the Republican Party and for the conservative movement.”\n\nSo far, little of the sparring has focused on substance. Late Tuesday evening, as election returns still trickled in, senior Cruz aides seemed unsure how they might proceed against Mr. Kasich.\n\nJeff Roe, Mr. Cruz’s campaign manager, suggested the senator stood to gain little from attacks on his unlikely rival.\n\n“That’d be the wrong move to start engaging with John Kasich,” Mr. Roe said, before adding that he might send “a calculator” to the Kasich campaign to signal the governor’s large delegate deficit, more than 250 behind Mr . Cruz. (Mr. Cruz himself is more than 250 behind Mr. Trump.)\n\nBut hours later, Mr. Johnson hinted that a look at Mr. Kasich’s résumé might be in order.\n\n“He has an interesting record that’s gone without examination,” he said coyly.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Kasich, Chris Schrimpf, welcomed an examination of the governor’s record both in Ohio and during his time in Congress. “Let’s compare Governor Kasich’s record when he was in Washington to Ted Cruz’s,” Mr. Schrimpf said. “What is Ted Cruz’s greatest accomplishment?”\n\nIf Mr. Cruz does plan to escalate hostilities, he seems likely to highlight Mr. Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio under the Affordable Care Act, a decision that puts him at odds with many conservatives.\n\nMr. Kasich has largely avoided offering direct criticism of other candidates, and his positivity is now at the center of his message, so it is not likely that he will go after Mr. Cruz in a direct way. Still, he has offered hints of how he views the senator’s campaign promises. At a town hall event in Michigan last week, he asked audience members to raise their hands if they believed that a year from now, after the election, the Internal Revenue Service would not exist and the country would have a 10 percent flat tax — two planks of Mr. Cruz’s campaign.\n\n“Not one hand has gone up!” Mr. Kasich observed.\n\nMr. Kasich’s team believes that Mr. Cruz’s message will not be well received in more moderate states that have yet to vote, like New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where Mr. Kasich was born and raised. “John Kasich’s story began in Pennsylvania,” read a flier at his event on Wednesday, showing the Pittsburgh skyline.\n\nAides to Mr. Cruz said he planned to campaign aggressively across the electoral map, despite the assumption that his message of conservative purity and religious faith could be a difficult fit in places like the Northeast. “If you think we’re ceding New York because Donald Trump hails from Queens and lives in Manhattan, that would be a mistake,” Mr. Johnson said.\n\nFirst, attention will turn to Arizona and Utah, which vote on Tuesday. With Mr. Trump poised to do well in Arizona, Mr. Cruz’s hopes are higher in Utah, powered by an endorsement from Senator Mike Lee. But Mr. Kasich, who plans to campaign there on Friday and advertise in the state, could undercut Mr. Cruz’s effort to sweep the state’s delegates with a majority of the vote.\n\nThe odds of either man catching Mr. Trump before the convention are long. And now it appears both candidates will have one less chance to prove themselves against him. Mr. Trump said Wednesday morning that he would skip a debate scheduled for Monday in Salt Lake City.\n\nMr. Kasich’s team signaled he would not attend without Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Cruz revived an attack he tried in January, when Mr. Trump missed a debate in Iowa. “#DuckingDonald strikes again,” Mr. Cruz posted on Twitter. “Tell @realDonaldTrump to debate.”\n\nBut by the afternoon, given the possibility of extremely low turnout, the debate was canceled."

   "ARTICLE": "New documents provide a close-up look at the life of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who left a remote base in eastern Afghanistan in June 2009. Sergeant Bergdahl, who was tortured during nearly five years in Taliban custody, was swapped in May 2014 for five Taliban detainees.\n\nThe circumstances of Sergeant Bergdahl’s disappearance led to an Army investigation and have become the subject of the second season of the popular podcast “Serial.” For his part, Sergeant Bergdahl has said that he left the base to draw attention to what he viewed as subpar leadership in his unit. Charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, Sergeant Bergdahl could face life in prison.\n\nIn an August 2014 interview with an Army investigator, Sergeant Bergdahl described his unusual upbringing, his competitiveness, his “fantastic plan” to leave the base in Afghanistan and his hope to move on with his life. Below are excerpts from that interview.\n\n“I was home schooled so I didn’t – I wasn’t raised in a very social environment and my parents raised me in a very strict, very religious setting. Obviously the Christian religion is a very ethical, moral religion. My father, despite the fact that he was never in the military, he was very – his mindset was very military. He raised me knowing how to shoot weapons. I have probably been doing that since I was 2 to 3 years old. So that has – the weapons and the very strict and very ethical environment that I was raised in – was the most prominent theme throughout my life. However, it wasn’t the best house to be in. …\n\nGrowing up the way I grew up, I also lacked the understanding of how to move through society. I am more comfortable in the mountains. I grew up in the mountains. You know, wandering around following cats, and dogs, and horses; that is what I grew up doing. That was my main experience. So when I got out in the world and I started trying to get jobs in cities, it was a little overwhelming.”\n\n“You put me in a room full of guys, I am not the type of guy that is not going to want to establish myself as the alpha male. I am not the pushover that can’t – that could happily go and sit on the sidelines and not – if I am not good at something, that bothers me. Do I want to be better than everybody else? No, I don’t want to be better than everyone else, but I do want to do – I don’t want to be arrogant about it, but I do want to be better than the average. I want to push myself.\n\nI grew up out in the middle of nowhere. I had very little interaction with technology. I had very little interaction with social structures. I had very little interaction with girls. You know, video games, not so much. So, on the average day, or average conversations, I would be lagging behind because I didn’t know all that stuff.\n\nI am an introvert. I have to actually put a lot of effort into being a conversationalist in social environments. I can’t go to parties because that just drains me. It takes a lot of effort to carry on in a regular conversation with somebody. So, I have a tendency, one, from very early on in life, being an introvert, and being – coming from the household that I came from, coming from my environment, I learned a long time ago, you learn more by listening and watching, and standing off to the side, plus being extremely shy, that is what I did naturally. ”\n\n“Prior to the Coast Guard, I had joined – I went to France to join the French Foreign Legion. The reason for the French Foreign Legion was – I’ll be honest, it was an adventurous sounding idea. I have always wanted to travel and I have always wanted to learn languages. And I have always had that interest of expanding my experience and understanding of the world. Unfortunately, I went all the way to Paris. I went to the fort and I tried to check-in. They did a physical on me and they told me because of my eyes they wouldn’t take me, which was honestly, kind of, a little bit of relief because by the time I got over there it was way overwhelming. I was there. I didn’t speak any French or anything like that. I was relieved. Honestly, I was relieved.”\n\nIn 2006, Sergeant Bergdahl had a psychological breakdown during Coast Guard training. He was discharged because of an “adjustment disorder with depression.” Two years later, he was allowed to enter the Army with a waiver.\n\n“Because of what my childhood was, I learned to stand on the sidelines and watch and listen to what was going on, and then think about it. When I got into the Coast Guard, that put me smack in view of the whole situation. They weren’t off to the side; they were right in your face. You were right there in the focal point and every action you were doing was pressured, and it was watched.\n\nWhat ended up happening was, I ended up having a panic attack, about three weeks into it. Again, I don’t have a good recollection of what happened. I just remember that it came about one evening when everyone was going down for roll call. What happened was, they got me to the hospital. And, in those moments, I think it was a psychiatrist – there was a couple people that were there.\n\nThey came in and asked me some questions. And I believe I said something about – I was trying to say, basically, ‘I can’t save these people.’ Because the pressure was, honestly, all the way up until that point, the information I was getting from my family, especially my dad, was that I can’t succeed in anything, that I am a failure.”\n\n“There were other guys who would always, whenever it came to a detail, would always disappear magically. There were these guys who just didn’t care. They had no respect for what they were doing there. They were there for a paycheck. …\n\nIt was just these people that shouldn’t have been in the Army. So I saw this element and it wasn’t just my platoon. It was all the platoons in basic training. Everybody had this story of these guys or that guy or this guy and what they were doing. The drill sergeant knew about it. The drill sergeants knew about it. The company captain knew about it. But they still graduated. So what I was doing when I was at my unit, I was seeing the actual effect of what happens when you let these people into a unit. …\n\nThe type of guys that shouldn’t have graduated are the guys who have blatantly showed that they have no respect for the Army, what it stands for, what the command is, and what we’re supposed to stand – what we as soldiers are supposed to represent.”\n\nSergeant Bergdahl describes his experience in early basic training. Below, N.T.C. stands for National Training Center and COIN is shorthand for counterinsurgency.\n\n“Then what I saw was, the sergeants that were around me, they were playing games. They were playing video games. One sergeant had his laptop. We were ordered, the privates were ordered to put our cellphones in our bags because we weren’t supposed to have them at N.T.C. and we are supposed to focus on our training. Then you have these sergeants with their laptops and you see them playing World of War Craft or something like that. …\n\nI came down to N.T.C. to train as a soldier, and I spent the majority of my time cleaning up; picking up cigarette butts and trash, or sorting through brass.\n\nSo here we are, we’re standing here, the sergeant major and the lieutenant colonel are doing their talks. The sergeant major is going to do his. He opens with, “I know you all joined because you want to rape, pillage and kill. That’s why I joined. However, you need to think about COIN.”\n\nSergeant Bergdahl described returning to an Afghanistan base after an extended mission in which his unit was stranded for six days, exchanged fire with the Taliban and was attacked with improvised explosive devices. A battalion commander, or B.C., Sergeant Bergdahl says, immediately criticized the members of his unit for not shaving:\n\n“There was no concern for his men’s well-being. The first thing that came out of his mind, as it came down the line and the radio was, our platoon sergeant stepped out of the truck onto the ground and the B.C. said to him, “What, you couldn’t shave?” His main concern was that after our extended mission for six days, after our two I.E.D.’s and a complex attack, after making it back finally, after all this mess, his main concern was the fact that, as soldiers, we didn’t think it was important to pack a shaver and shaving cream.\n\nSo, I was looking at that and I was going, ‘That was my option. Nobody is going to listen to me. Nobody is going to say anything. Nobody is going to say anything.’ And if I go to my squad sergeant, if I go to my platoon sergeant, if I go to the higher commanders that are under the B.C., they are not going to do anything because they don’t want to rock the boat.\n\nBut I was looking at a situation that could very easily go south. Like worst case scenario, we get sent on a suicide mission. But, all right, but what if? That is one thing. What if this guy isn’t fit for his duty? Then what happens?” “So, I had to come up with some plan because I knew nobody else was going to do anything about it. Everybody else was going to keep their heads down and just try to ride it out. That is what you are supposed to do.\n\nNot only am I a soldier here, but I am also a citizen of America. And that means, their well-being goes [beyond the immediate moment], you know, my concern isn’t just for my immediate surroundings. It is for the bigger picture. Army is America’s Army. It is not the general’s Army. It is not the captain’s Army. It is America’s Army. So, as a citizen of America, I have that duty as well. To make sure that – you know, someone would say, ‘You are just a private. You don’t have the authority to be questioning your higher ranks.’ …\n\nAnd as a private first class, where I was standing, I was seeing around me all this just stupid bullshit. And I was seeing things heading in a very dangerous direction. So, I had to do something. It had to be me doing it. And so I came up, happily with my ignorance of a young – from a young man’s mind and my imagination, I came up with a fantastic plan.”\n\nIn the interview, Sergeant Bergdahl discussed his plan to leave the base and create a DUSTWUN, a military term for a missing-soldier procedure, that he believed would draw attention to flaws in Army leadership. He told Army investigators that he planned to gather intelligence on the Taliban’s movements and report that to superiors:\n\n“I wasn’t planning on making contact with the Taliban at all. What I was planning on doing was I was planning on moving along the route that I believed there were guys putting I.E.D.’s in.\n\nMy original plan was to run in the night, daytime comes, cover myself, and wait for evening to come again, and run at night and get to point B. …\n\nSo this took me into the night and the plan was to find people moving in the darkness in a suspicious way by a road or something like that. …\n\nThings I took with me were what was in my pockets, my wallet. I had my camera. I always had that, even when I was on patrol; always had a digital camera. I had my notebook. I had a few personal journal entries and poems. A newspaper article about a guy who had made a record sailing a boat; self-contained sailing for a thousand days or something. So I had that in there.\n\nI had my knives because I am a knife person – I like knives. They are very functional tools. They have a very large meaning out west. I also had my pocketknife; I always have a pocketknife. I grabbed a pack of chicken meat from an M.R.E., a pack of nuts from my trail mix, my compass and my belt.”\n\n“People have talked about desertion. People have talked about treason or whatever it is that they want to talk about. They want to talk about, ‘Oh, he was a sympathizer of the Taliban.’ All right. You look at their ideology and what they are doing and you look at my character. And you want to ask me questions about that, I will happily talk all day about the joke of what they are [the Taliban]. All right. I am, for lack of a better word, a feminist. I fully believe in women’s equality.\n\nYou have met Kim Harrison. I call her my godmother because that is the type of person that I find as, you know, a senior role model. She is that type of person. I fully believe in that. So, sympathizer to the Taliban is a complete joke and you can talk to me all day about it and I will happily rip it up one side and down the other, and leave it completely lacking in any theories.”\n\nAt one point in the interview, Sergeant Bergdahl discusses a reference he made to John Galt, a character in Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged.” Sergeant Bergdahl is not able to remember if the reference came in an email to friends or in a journal, but he explains what he meant by the line “Who is John Galt?”:\n\n“When I mentioned John Galt, it’s not referencing politics. What it’s referencing is the fact that in “Atlas Shrugged,” John Galt, his mission is to end, basically, the system. …\n\n‘Who is John Galt?’ I’m referencing the fact that the reason why that quote came about was because John Galt, at the very beginning, where he saw it happening, he saw communists coming, he saw the corruptness of the system coming, he walked out and said, ‘I’m going to stop this engine. I’m going to stop the engine of the world.’ I’m a very mechanically inclined person. I like engines. I like the puzzle, the way everything fits so smoothly. So it resonated with me.”\n\n“On my personal part, after the last five years that I have been through, it would be, I don’t think, too – I don’t want to go with brash, too exaggerated to say that, [the last five years] that was a little more than any prison system in America could put forth, if we are talking punishment for action. I read on the Internet somebody saying, ‘Well, if charges of desertion were pressed, then he would spend five years in prison.’ If you put it in that sense, realistically speaking, what I dealt with isn’t in the American prison system because we go to great extent of giving prisoners the luxuries of being human.\n\nFrom my personal perspective, given the opportunity to move on with my life, which has been what has kept me going. The ability to get back to this life and being the perfectionist that I am, make up for all of the things I had to look at as regrets.\n\nDo I need anything to move on with my life? Yes, obviously I need something as a human being. I can pull myself up like I did before. I started at the bottom before; I can start at the bottom. …\n\nSo your decision is going to be your decision. This is just coming from my side. I’m going to be, as a soldier, I am going to understand that as the commander, as the general, you have the big picture. You have to look at everything, details to the bigger picture, and your decisions are going to be made off of your understanding of the situation and your experience in all the years that you have been there. You are going to make your decision and I am going to respect that.”"

   "ARTICLE": "Buses overflowed, bike lanes swelled and highways across Maryland and Virginia were stop-and-go as this city crawled its way through two elongated and unpredictable rush hours on Wednesday, brought on by a decision to shutter the region’s subway system for an emergency safety inspection.\n\nBut for much of the day in downtown Washington, where Metro, as the region’s subway is known, was gated shut, there was relative calm, as street and foot traffic — made lighter by legions of workers clocking in from home — moved at a steady clip. Many who went about their weekday routines said they could deal with a day’s disruption if it meant safer rides on a public transportation system where reliability and safety have become perennial concerns.\n\nLate Wednesday afternoon, Paul J. Wiedefeld, Metro’s general manager, said that the inspections had helped to do just that and that he had authorized the system to reopen on Thursday morning as planned, after repairs to more than two dozen cables found to be damaged are completed.\n\n“I know this has presented hardship to the region,” Mr. Wiedefeld said at a news conference. “The shutdown today was necessary.”\n\nThe closing came as officials fanned out across the system’s six lines and 91 stations to inspect about 600 electrical cables on what is known as the third rail. One of those cables, in a downtown tunnel, caught fire on Monday, creating long delays and evoking memories of a similar episode in January 2015 that resulted in one passenger’s death while sickening several others.\n\nMr. Wiedefeld said that by 5 p.m. Wednesday, inspection crews had found 26 areas where similar cables or connector boots needed to be replaced. Inspectors were expected to continue working throughout the night and, if necessary, into Thursday if any additional problems were found.\n\nThe decision to close Metro, which was hastily announced on Tuesday afternoon after Mr. Wiedefeld consulted with Metro’s board of directors, displaced hundreds of thousands of subway riders and led many area residents to work from home.\n\nRiders take about 700,000 trips a day on Metro’s lines, which are the second busiest in the country. About 38 percent of the city’s work force uses some form of public transportation to get to work, according to the United States Census Bureau.\n\n“Just take a deep breath because you can’t really do anything about it,” said Marilia Rojas, a student at the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, said near the White House about 8 a.m.\n\nA regular Metro rider, Ms. Rojas, 24, said she was not all that surprised when she heard the system would shut down for the day given its problems. But after her hour-and-a-half commute from her home in suburban Bethesda, Md., took three times as long, she was considering a lifestyle change.\n\nMorning commuters boarded a bus for downtown Washington in Silver Spring, Md., on Wednesday. The closing of the Metro system came as officials fanned out across six lines and 91 stations to inspect about 600 electrical cables. Credit Gary Cameron/Reuters\n“It makes me want to move into the city or something,” she said.\n\nWednesday’s closing was the latest in a string of setbacks for Metro, a system billed as a modern marvel when it opened here four decades ago but better known in recent years for revenue shortages, management problems and aging infrastructure.\n\nThe system’s failings were most notably on display in June 2009, when one train slammed into another. killing eight passengers and a train operator. But riders consistently report service delays, cancellations and exceptionally long wait times, a recent internal report found. Ridership, in turn, has dropped in recent months to low levels not seen here in a decade.\n\nIn October, the transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, directed the Federal Transit Administration to take responsibility for Metro safety as the three jurisdictions that normally oversee it — Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia — were ordered to set up a new, more powerful safety oversight body that would comply with federal standards. The jurisdictions have not yet done so.\n\n“For months, I have called on the jurisdictions to form an effective state safety oversight organization,” Mr. Foxx said during a previously scheduled appearance before a Senate committee on Wednesday. “And yet we have no concrete movement on the part of these jurisdictions. That would be a good start.”\n\nMr. Foxx said he ordered the transit agency to locate unspent Metro funds that could be used for safety improvements and to begin conducting “a safety inspection blitz” next week focused on operators running red lights, track integrity and the use of emergency breaks.\n\n“I don’t think it’s just resources,” that will solve Metro’s problems, he said. “I think it is culture and I think it is a deliberate decision needed by those involved in this.”\n\nDespite dire warnings on Capitol Hill and around Washington in the hours after its announcement, closings around the region were rare and schools, hospitals and most other institutions were largely unaffected. Students who could not make it to classes in Washington’s public schools had their absences excused.\n\nSpring break tourists enjoying the warm weather outside the White House said they were traveling the region by bus and had been unaffected by the closing.\n\nMetro’s bus service — and its competitors — raced to absorb the thousands of displaced commuters. The D.C. Circulator, a limited city-run bus service, did not charge riders for the day, nor did Capital Bikeshare. Uber and Lyft both offered credits to first-time riders; Uber reported record number of its drivers on the city’s roadways.\n\nAt Union Station, Washington’s ground transportation hub near the Capitol, there was a noticeable dearth of commuters as many employers offered the option to work from home. The escalators from the underground Metro station there continued to run, eerily devoid of workers and tourists for a weekday morning. A few who traveled by Amtrak or one of the regional train systems waited for taxis in a short line out front, mumbling about how inconvenient the shutdown was.\n\nJohn Heffner, 70, of Alexandria, Va., said he was trying to accommodate what he saw as a wise decision on the part of Metro officials.\n\nStill, Mr. Heffner, an attorney who focuses on rail transportation law, said, “If this happened in New York, it would be revolution.”"

   "ARTICLE": "When the video appeared on Facebook, it was as compelling as it was shaky and shocking: Using a contraband device, a state prisoner recorded and narrated nearly a minute of a prison riot here that had already led to a fire and the stabbings of two officials, including the warden.\n\n“It’s going down,” the man said, his voice muffled by a makeshift white bandanna.\n\nThe expletive-laden video was a stark glimpse of the violence and chaos that corrections experts say is a relentless threat in overcrowded prisons like those in Alabama, where the nation’s most congested state corrections system houses more than 24,000 inmates in a network designed for 13,318. That uprising on Friday, as well as two others in Alabama’s prisons in a week, intensified questions about how this state, one of the nation’s poorest, should end an overcrowding crisis that has long shadowed governors and prison officials.\n\n“What we have today in Alabama makes it dangerous for not only the inmates, it makes it dangerous also for our guards and our wardens and anybody who is involved in this situation,” Gov. Robert Bentley said Tuesday during a visit to the William C. Holman Correctional Facility, the site of Alabama’s execution chamber and of two outbreaks of violence since Friday night.\n\nIn part because of decades of severe sentencing laws that Alabama has only just begun to pivot away from, Mr. Bentley, a Republican, is presiding over a corrections system that is under extraordinary stress from overcrowding.\n\n“When there’s overcrowding in a facility, it leads to tremendous levels of tension between inmates, between inmates and staff, and it puts a strain on all of the resources of the facility,” said Michele Deitch, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas who was a court-appointed monitor for the Texas prison system. “The combination of all of those things can very easily lead to violence.”\n\nWhen unrest that lasted for hours erupted here late Friday, there were only 17 guards supervising more than 900 prisoners at Holman, which was built in the late 1960s and designed to accommodate 581 inmates. (State officials say the facility’s capacity can be stretched, uncomfortably, to more than 1,000 prisoners.)\n\nJefferson S. Dunn, the corrections commissioner, said Tuesday that the bedlam began when a guard was stabbed while trying to break up a fight between prisoners. The warden, Carter Davenport, was attacked when he and other officials arrived at the dormitory, where about 100 prisoners were being held. The men set a fire — Mr. Bentley said they might have used baby oil as an accelerant — before emergency response teams used tear gas to quell the uprising.\n\nTroubles at Women’s Prison Test Alabama MARCH 1, 2014\nThe unrest resumed in the same dormitory Monday morning, Mr. Dunn said, when a guard was “met with resistance” after one inmate stabbed another, and prisoners ultimately barricaded the area. The episode ended within hours, but Holman remained on lockdown on Tuesday. When Mr. Bentley toured the complex, a tactical squadron of state troopers augmented his traditional security detail.\n\n“Part of the prison sentence is punishment,” Mr. Bentley said in Holman’s visitation room, not far from barbed wire, brick guard towers and signs of allegiance to the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. “We know that. But you’ve got to protect people.”\n\nThe violence at Holman came days before a State Senate committee was to consider Mr. Bentley’s proposal that Alabama issue up to $800 million in bonds to build four new prisons and close many existing ones. Each of the three prisons for men would house at least 3,500 inmates. The fourth compound would replace the state’s women’s prisons, including the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women, the subject of a 2015 settlement between Alabama and the Department of Justice after investigators found evidence of widespread sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough Republicans control the Legislature, Mr. Bentley’s prisons plan has hardly zipped through the State House, where lobbyists for the construction industry have expressed concerns that the work would go to out-of-state firms. Other critics have questioned the governor’s assertions that the project would save the state money over the long term. On Tuesday morning, State Senator Greg Albritton, who represents this area, stood a few feet away from Mr. Bentley and would not commit to voting for the governor’s proposal.\n\nThe plan’s detractors have also voiced pointed questions about their fears that Alabama officials have devised an expensive, high-profile strategy that would do little to change the culture of the state’s prisons.\n\n“I don’t think the problem has anything to do with the physical state of these prisons,” said Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, an Alabama-based group that has criticized and sued the state over its prisons. “There are some reforms that are needed there, but if we think that building supermax prisons is going to solve the problems that we have, we are really being delusional.”\n\nMr. Stevenson, who condemned Holman as one of the Deep South’s “plantation prisons that have long, difficult, ugly histories of abuse and isolation,” added, “We have done just horrific things to the culture and climate in these prisons, so we’re going to have to have a complete reorientation.”\n\nBut Mr. Bentley and his supporters argue that modernized facilities, coupled with last year’s approval of some of the country’s most ambitious sentencing program overhauls, are similarly crucial to a permanent fix for a corrections system that spent more than a decade under the oversight of a Federal District Court.\n\nWorries that the courts might again seize control of Alabama’s prisons, as the Council of State Governments recently warned was a possibility, have helped shape the debate in Montgomery, the state capital.\n\n“You don’t have a lot of choices here,” State Senator Cam Ward, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. “Either you’re going to spend some money and do some construction and major reforms within the sentencing process, or the federal government or a federal court is going to come in and say, ‘You’re going to do it, and you’re still going to pay for it.’ ”\n\nThis month’s uprisings and their graphic display, people on both sides of the debate said, showcased the urgency and depth of the troubles here. But still, some worried that in the absence of an agreement, or before one, the turmoil in the prisons could worsen.\n\n“It’s tragic, frankly, that it requires violence and fires and stabbings to get people to pay attention to the dire conditions in these prisons,” said Mr. Stevenson, who has represented Holman prisoners. “Unfortunately in these circumstances, conditions usually get worse rather than better, especially for the incarcerated people. That’s my fear.”"

   "ARTICLE": "An area in the windy waters off Long Island has been designated as a possible site for a wind farm, the federal government announced on Wednesday.\n\nNew Yorkers will not be seeing offshore turbines anytime soon, however. The Interior Department and its Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said they were moving toward auctioning a lease for the site, about 11 nautical miles off the coast of Long Beach and stretching about 26 nautical miles to the southeast.\n\nThe process of planning the wind farm, which could take several years, involves environmental assessment, an auction, further assessments of the site and construction plans, and an environmental impact report. Much of the planning is also submitted to the public for comment.\n\nThis site, about 127 square miles, was chosen after the New York Power Authority, a state agency, submitted a proposal to the ocean energy bureau to build wind turbines there in 2011.\n\nThe agency’s regulations required that it make the proposal public to determine if other entities were interested in building a wind farm in that area. According to the ocean energy bureau, five private companies, Fishermen’s Energy, Energy Management, Deepwater Wind, EDF Renewable Energy and Sea Breeze Energy, have expressed interest in developing the site.\n\nThus far, the federal government has issued 11 leases for wind farms on the East Coast from Virginia to Massachusetts. The country’s first offshore wind farm, in the waters off Block Island, R.I., is under construction.\n\nThe plan to auction a lease for the site follows a surprising decision by President Obama this week not to allow oil or gas drilling off the southeastern Atlantic coast, a victory for environmental advocates and coastal communities who had opposed a previous plan that would have permitted it.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, said, “New York has tremendous offshore wind potential, and today’s milestone marks another important step in the president’s strategy to tap clean, renewable energy from the nation’s vast wind and solar resources.”\n\nIn its proposal, the Power Authority said the site could host 194 wind turbines, each generating 3.6 megawatts for a total possible yield of 700 megawatts — or, by some estimates, enough to provide electricity to nearly 300,000 homes.\n\nThis project is not the first offshore wind farm proposed in the New York area. Other proposed locations have included the former landfill on Staten Island that is now Freshkills Park, and New York Harbor. Leases for two so-called wind energy areas were recently awarded for the waters off Atlantic City. And last year, the first turbine arrived on the shores of Brooklyn.\n\nOffshore wind farms have previously been the subject of intense debate — notably, the Cape Wind project in the Nantucket Sound off Cape Cod. While the lease for that site has been awarded, the turbines have yet to be built, largely because of funding troubles, though the project also faced considerable opposition from residents, fishermen and business owners.\n\nIf a wind farm is developed off the southern shore of Long Island, it may inspire more muted protests from homeowners, if any, in part because it is far from the shore at its eastern end.\n\nPerhaps in anticipation of some of those arguments, the ocean energy bureau has created video simulations of the turbines from several spots in New York — Fire Island, Jones Beach, Jacob Riis Park — and from Sandy Hook and Asbury Park in New Jersey.\n\nKit Kennedy, the director of energy and transportation for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said public opinion about offshore wind is different from what it was at the height of the fight over Cape Wind.\n\nThe federal government has since streamlined the process of building offshore wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean, as part of the “Smart From the Start” initiative.\n\nMs. Kennedy said the prospects for broader embrace of renewable energy projects, reinforced by the president’s announcement this week, were encouraging.\n\n“We’ve come a long way,” Ms. Kennedy said. “It’s a new day for offshore wind.”"

   "ARTICLE": "Irate protesters have charged for years that police officers kill black people with impunity, but that anger yielded something new on Tuesday in the counties that include Chicago and Cleveland, where voters defeated the prosecutors they held partly responsible.\n\nIn each place, one particular shooting in 2014, captured on video, galvanized attention, locally and nationally: the death in Chicago of Laquan McDonald, 17, and the killing in Cleveland of Tamir Rice, 12.\n\nTim McGinty, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor, announced in December that a grand jury had declined to indict the officers involved in Tamir’s death, making it clear that he agreed. And Anita Alvarez, the state’s attorney for Cook County, waited 13 months before taking action against the officer who killed Mr. McDonald, filing a murder charge only after a judge ordered that video of the shooting be made public.\n\nIn Democratic primaries on Tuesday, both veteran prosecutors were soundly defeated by lesser-known challengers. In each county, the campaign became a referendum on the incumbent, with some protesters stating plainly that they would vote for any viable alternative.\n\n“There’s no way that we could condone Anita Alvarez being our state’s attorney for another term,” said Veronica Morris Moore, a leader of a coalition of black community groups called the Bye Anita Campaign. “This does not mean that we believe in Kim Foxx,” the winning challenger.\n\nCritics of law enforcement hope the results send a message to prosecutors, but they do not claim they are part of a trend. In Missouri, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, Robert McCulloch, easily won re-election in 2014, days before announcing that a grand jury there had not indicted an officer for killing Michael Brown in Ferguson. In New York, the Staten Island district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan, won election to Congress in 2015, after a grand jury decided not to indict an officer in the death of Eric Garner.\n\n“It’s really hard to gauge whether it’s something that’s going to spread or not,” said Representative Marcia Fudge, Democrat of Ohio, a critic of Mr. McGinty and the Cleveland police. “It always depends on the case. In Cleveland, it was a number of things that came together, kind of a perfect storm.”\n\nChicago’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, and the former police superintendent Garry McCarthy have been battered over the McDonald case and other police shootings; Mr. Emanuel has become so unpopular that in the Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders’s campaign worked hard to link the mayor to Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut Mr. McCarthy was ousted in December, and Mr. Emanuel, after being forced into a runoff, survived a re-election fight last year, before the release of the McDonald video. That left Ms. Alvarez as the target for voters’ ire. Signs and social media posts often paired the hashtags #ByeAnita and #ByeRahm.\n\n“I’ve been criticized that I wasn’t a very good politician, and that’s probably right,” she told supporters on election night. “But I’m very damn proud of the fact that I am a good prosecutor.”\n\nCritics claimed that she had dragged her feet in charging Officer Jason Van Dyke, who fired 16 shots into Mr. McDonald, who was holding a knife but walking away. They also said she had intentionally botched the prosecution of Detective Dante Servin in the shooting of Rekia Boyd, an unarmed woman. Ms. Alvarez vehemently denied those charges.\n\n“She had been under fire for a number of things, but there’s no doubt that the Laquan McDonald case was the crystallizing factor,” said Dick Simpson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and a former Chicago alderman. “People blamed her and Rahm Emanuel and Garry McCarthy, but only she was on the ballot.”\n\nTamir was shot while playing in a park with a realistic-looking pellet gun, at a time when the Cleveland police were already under a Justice Department investigation that found a pattern of civil rights violations and excessive force. In the Rice case, like those in Staten Island and Ferguson, people clamoring for the officers to be charged accused Mr. McGinty of steering the grand jury away from prosecution.\n\nA few months later, they accused Mr. McGinty’s office of mishandling the prosecution of an officer, one of several who had fired more than 100 shots into a car, killing two unarmed people. The officer was acquitted at trial. And Mr. McGinty stirred new resentment over the Rice case in November, when he said that the boy’s mother and her lawyer, in criticizing him, “have their own economic motives.”\n\nMr. McGinty lost on Tuesday by about 12 percentage points to Michael O’Malley, a former Cleveland councilman and former prosecutor. Ms. Foxx, a former prosecutor, defeated Ms. Alvarez by about 19 points.\n\nIn both cases, winning the Democratic primary is tantamount to winning office. No Republican filed to run in Cuyahoga County, and in heavily Democratic Cook County, the Republican candidate, Christopher E. Pfannkuche, is relatively unknown."

   "ARTICLE": "Elwyn L. Simons, an intrepid scientist known as the father of modern primate paleontology for his discovery of some of humankind’s earliest antecedents, died on March 6 in Peoria, Ariz. He was 85.\n\nHis death was announced by Duke University, where he was an emeritus professor of evolutionary anthropology.\n\nThough Dr. Simons’s career took in myriad fossils, including whales’ feet (in the distant past in which his professional life was lived, the footed whale was no oxymoron), he was concerned in particular with the earliest primates.\n\n“Elwyn made an enormous and really incomparable contribution to the science of human origins, particularly at the very early end of the scale — the background out of which our hominid lineage emerged,” Ian Tattersall, an emeritus curator in the division of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.\n\nDr. Simons was equal parts scientist and adventurer: In leading more than 90 expeditions — to Egypt, India, Iran, Libya, Madagascar, Wyoming and elsewhere — he braved badlands, weathered sandstorms, dodged unexploded World War II land mines and crawled through limestone caves in pursuit of his venerable quarry.\n\n“He was an indefatigable fossil-finder,” Dr. Tattersall said. “He probably has found, in his career, more fossils bearing on primate evolution than anybody of his generation.”\n\nDr. Simons did not so much dig as divine.\n\n“He had the golden touch for finding fossils,” Dr. Tattersall said. “In the kind of paleontology that Elwyn did, you don’t really dig. What you do is you scour the landscape to see what is eroding up from below or being carried down along the slope from above.” He added:\n\n“He would go to the places where the fossils were — and that is an extraordinary thing, because you don’t know where the fossils are to begin with. But he had an unerring sense of where the fossils ought to be.”\n\nContinue reading the main story\nDr. Simons carried out much of his work in the Fayum region of Egypt, some 60 miles southwest of Cairo. Today a desert, it was, many millions of years ago, a forested swamp teeming with early primates.\n\n“Tracing human ancestry is sort of like tracing your family tree,” Dr. Simons told United Press International in 1990. “Once you find out who your great-grandfather was, then you want to know who his father was.”\n\nHis most seminal find, made in the Fayum in the mid-1960s, was the skull of a cat-size, tree-dwelling primate he called Aegyptopithecus. The creature — about 33 million years old — was, on its discovery, the earliest known common forebear of apes, monkeys and man.\n\nAs David R. Pilbeam, the Henry Ford II professor of human evolution at Harvard, said on Tuesday: “Aegyptopithecus is probably the best-known example of a fossil primate that predates the split between the hominoids — that’s that group containing the living apes and humans — and the cercopithecoids: the Old World monkeys. It’s not clear at the moment exactly when those two groups split, but probably about 25 to 30 million years ago.”\n\nDr. Simons and his team later turned up more Aegyptopithecus skulls — finds that suggested the creature was no towering intellectual.\n\n“What was astonishing is how small this brain is,” Dr. Simons told a consortium of Australian newspapers in 2007. “You can also see it’s a pretty darn primitive brain. It would be small for a monkey or an ape. So it’s telling us that the speed of achievement of brain enlargement in primates was a little slower than perhaps we thought.”\n\nDr. Simons was equally concerned with living primates, serving for many years as the director of the Duke University Primate Center, as it was then known. The center, now the Duke Lemur Center, studies and breeds rare and endangered primates — which over the years have included lemurs, tarsiers and lorises — and has reintroduced some of its lemurs to the wild in Madagascar.\n\n“He was thinking of a very broad picture for understanding the origins of primates by looking at the ones that are alive today that are the most ancient,” Patricia Wright, a distinguished professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University, said on Tuesday. “Tarsiers are very ancient primates; lemurs are very ancient primates.”\n\nDr. Simons helped establish Parc Ivoloina, a conservation center in eastern Madagascar for lemurs and other native species. In recognition of his work there, he was made a knight of the National Order of the Republic of Madagascar.\n\nWhile it is atypical for a paleontologist to have a second career in wildlife conservation, for Dr. Simons the two trades dovetailed seamlessly.\n\n“He wanted to see those fossils alive!” Dr. Wright, who did postdoctoral work with him at the Duke center, explained. “And so he wanted to know everything about them. Those bones can be frustrating: They can teach you a lot, but they can’t always teach you what you want to know.”\n\nElwyn LaVerne Simons, whose most immediate lineal forebears were Verne Simons and the former Verna Cuddeback, was born on July 14, 1930, in Lawrence, Kan., and reared in Houston.\n\nVisiting an exhibition as a young child, he saw a reconstituted dinosaur and promptly burst into tears. But fascination soon overcame fright, and the tears turned to howls of protest when his father tried to lead him away.\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor’s degree from Rice University, the young Mr. Simons earned master’s and doctoral degrees from Princeton and a second doctorate from Oxford.\n\nDr. Simons taught at Yale, where his students included the future Dr. Tattersall and Dr. Pilbeam, before joining the Duke faculty in 1977. After retiring from Duke in 2011, he lived in Peoria.\n\nOther finds on expeditions led by Dr. Simons include Catopithecus, a primate somewhat older than Aegyptopithecus. He was a member of a joint expedition by Duke and the University of Michigan that in 1989 turned up the fossil remains of whales’ hind feet and legs in the Egyptian desert — for where else would one hunt whales but in the desert? (It had once been a sea.)\n\nThe discovery showed that even after whales quit the land for a life at sea some 50 million years ago, they retained vestigial, but still functional, lower limbs for a good 10 million years more.\n\nDr. Simons’s first marriage, to Mary Hoyt Fitch, ended in divorce. His survivors include his second wife, Friderun Ankel-Simons, a physical anthropologist and frequent collaborator; their two children, Cornelia Seiffert and Verne Simons; a son from his first marriage, D. Brenton Simons, a genealogist concerned with human ancestors of more recent vintage; a brother, Herbert; and five grandchildren. A daughter from his first marriage, Katherine Egan, died in 2009.\n\nAmid the forbidding conditions in which he sometimes worked, Dr. Simons was sustained by his constitutional puckish humor.\n\n“I remember him telling me that he discovered a very important tool in paleontology, and this is what he should be known for,” Dr. Wright said on Tuesday. To her astonishment, she recalled, he opened a closet and emerged with an ordinary household broom.\n\n“I sweep the desert,” he declared.\n\nAnd, indeed, whenever Dr. Simons scoured the sands for his ancestors, he brought his broom along."

   "ARTICLE": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is determined to continue his campaign despite losing at least four of the five states that voted on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, and his senior campaign adviser, Tad Devine, spoke to reporters on Wednesday afternoon and said that Mr. Sanders could make up Hillary Clinton’s delegate lead. They added that Mr. Sanders expected to do well in the coming elections in Arizona, Idaho, New York, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.\n\n“We are literally about halfway through,” Mr. Weaver said. “Clearly the Clinton campaign has run up a bit of a lead in the first half of it, but the second half is much more favorable to Senator Sanders in terms of the calendar, in terms of the geography, in terms of the spacing of the states.”\n\nMr. Weaver added that campaign advisers still see a path forward. “What our calculation shows is that we can in fact pass the secretary in pledged delegates,” he said. “We are feeling very good, and we are essentially where we expected to be at this point in the race.”\n\nMr. Devine echoed those sentiments. “We agree we are behind, but we also think we are going to win this game,” Mr. Devine said. “We are just not intimidated by the numbers.”\n\nThe two men also said that it would be unfair to not allow voters in all states to be able to cast their ballots for Mr. Sanders and that the senator had the money to continue his campaign through the convention this summer."

   "ARTICLE": "After months of campaigning on both sides of the issue — and some reports of confusion over ballot language — Columbia voters on Tuesday passed Proposition 1 to ban any transition to an automated trash collection system with roll carts, or wheeled bins, for at least six months.\n\nWith all of the city’s 38 precincts counted, about 53.8 percent of Columbia voters, or 17,728 people, had voted in favor of the proposition; 15,214 “no” ballots were cast, accounting for about 46.2 percent of votes.\n\nThe campaign in support of the initiative was led by the Solid Waste Advocacy Group, or SWAG, which placed the roll cart question before voters using an initiative petition last year. SWAG held a watch party for the election results at Shakespeare’s South and drew a cheery crowd of about 30 residents who had supported the drive to keep Columbia’s black trash bag system.\n\nThe prevailing “yes” vote means the city council is barred from making any changes to the city’s trash collection system for six months. After that, the city council would be free to change city code again to accommodate a new trash collection system.\n\nBefore final results were in Tuesday, City Manager Mike Matthes said the city would respect voter wishes in the event of a “yes” vote. He said the city likely would wait at least a year regardless of the results of the election before discussing any potential changes to the trash system.\n\nThird Ward Councilman Karl Skala, however, said the relatively close vote means he suspects the council will take up the issue again in six months. He said he still would like to consider a hybrid approach to trash collection that would allow residents to choose between trash bags or roll carts.\n\nSkala said he heard reports of voters being confused by the ballot language, which asked voters to vote “yes” to ban roll carts. He said confusion at the polls might have affected the outcome.\n\n“I would love to say people are informed when they go to the polls, but that isn’t always so,” Skala said.\n\nAttendees of the SWAG watch party said they did not think their fight to keep the existing trash system was over. Under the current system, trash is bagged and put on the curb for pickup. SWAG member Rick Shanker said he thought the city would not respect a “yes” vote earned by a small margin.\n\n“Even if we win by 70 percent, this is not over,” Shanker said to other SWAG supporters. “We already had a victory dinner about three years ago. We’ve still got a fight ahead of us.”\n\nShanker said the group plans to hold more meetings to discuss concerns with the city’s solid waste collection system, including high employee turnover and a significant number of workers’ compensation claims. SWAG has advocated for better working conditions and ways to increase recycling, he said, but the group largely has been ignored by the city.\n\n“There still is certainly more to discuss,” he said.\n\nThe Committee for Roll Cart Choice led the campaign to defeat Proposition 1. After the results of the election, members discussed potentially reviving the issue in the form of an initiative petition after the six-month waiting period.\n\nCommittee member Rob Rasmussen said motivation to bring the issue back is partly because the ballot language confused some voters.\n\nRasmussen said both groups want the best solid waste collection system for Columbia but that they have different ideas of what that system might entail.\n\nHe said he hopes the issue comes back for discussion.\n\n“One group believes we have reached the apex and successfully shut out exploration of alternatives,” Rasmussen said. “I believe, as many others, that there is much room for improvement.”"

   "ARTICLE": "Bernie Sanders’ local supporters found solace on a bad night for their candidate in his victory in Boone County and, it seemed for most of the night, Missouri as well.\n\nVolunteers filled the Vermont senator’s local headquarters Tuesday evening, watching as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took Democratic primaries in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. But in Boone County, Sanders received 60.6 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 38.7 percent.\n\nThat margin was similar to the 2008 result, when then-Sen. Barack Obama defeated Clinton with 60.5 percent of the vote.\n\nClinton eked out an apparent statewide victory of 1,531 votes, erasing a Sanders margin that earlier had been as much as 19,000 votes, or about 4 percent of the total, on the strength of solid victories in Kansas City and St. Louis. Vote totals for Sanders and Clinton were within 0.5 percent of each other, so Sanders may request a recount under state law.\n\nThe volunteers will not stop working, said Danielle Muscato, a spokeswoman for Mid-Missourians for Bernie, because the next step is electing friendly delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\n“We’ve got lots and lots of volunteers ready to do what we have to do to make sure progressive voices are represented at the convention,” Muscato said.\n\nThe Republican side was equally close, with businessman Donald Trump winning statewide by 1,726 votes over Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. That apparent victory, also subject to recount, secured Trump 12 at-large delegates. Cruz scored a solid victory in Boone County and carried the Fourth Congressional District, earning its five delegates.\n\nWith all Boone County precincts reporting, Cruz had 43.9 percent of the vote compared with 30.9 percent for Trump. Ohio Gov. John Kasich garnered 14.5 percent, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio trailing with 8.2 percent.\n\nBoone County Republican Chairman Mike Zweifel said he’s not ready to concede that Trump will be the party’s nominee, adding that it will be difficult to stop him after victories in Florida, North Carolina and Illinois.\n\n“He has half the delegates needed,” Zweifel said. “I don’t think it is over, but at the same time it is a lot harder for someone to beat him in the upcoming primaries.”\n\nBoone County Clerk Wendy Noren counted 51,019 ballots, a turnout of 54 percent of active registered voters. The turnout and total are far more than the 41,903 counted in 2008, the last time both parties had nominating contests. The increase was all on the Republican side, where more than 10,000 new primary voters went to the polls.\n\nThe Democratic primary drew more than 1,000 fewer voters than 2008.\n\nThroughout the day, the county clerk’s office had been deluged with calls from people needing to file a late change of address or complete their registration information, Noren said.\n\nThe primary will be followed by the caucuses that begin the selection of party members to fill delegate slots.\n\nBoone County Democrats will gather at 7:30 p.m. April 7 for a countywide mass meeting at Gentry Middle School, 4200 Bethel St. County Chairman Homer Page said the local delegates to the Fourth Congressional District convention and the Democratic State Convention will be allocated based on the county result.\n\nBoone County Republicans will meet at 10 a.m. April 9 at the Holiday Inn Executive Center under rules that will allow opponents of the winner an opportunity to elect their partisans as delegates. If the nomination is not settled when the national convention is held, the true allegiance — rather than the pledged allegiance for the first ballot based on the primary results — could become an important factor.\n\nEach campaign that wishes to compete for the GOP local delegation must put up a complete slate of 45 delegates and 45 alternates and then turn out voters for the caucus.\n\n“Any of the candidates can come and do that, but there have been some people talking about a unity slate of some sort, people who have helped out with the party for a long time,” Zweifel said."

Group members said spending federal funds on services often comes with mandatory minority hiring practices and asked the city manager if the city could implement similar policies.\n\nThe city’s only requirements for hiring contractors are part of the bidding process, in which the city typically selects the lowest bid for a contract unless there are special circumstances, Matthes said. City code allows the city manager to enter into contracts for professional or other services without competitive bidding or a request for proposals “when factors such as prior experience, skills, education, local knowledge or unique knowledge” influence the selection process. City code also allows Matthes to waive attorney conflicts of interest.\n\nMatthes said any policy change must go through the council but that he can act unilaterally to change hiring practices for city employees. At the request of Race Matters member Warren Sapp, the city manager committed to making the change.\n\n“I don’t think there will be legal barriers, but sometimes I’ve been surprised,” Matthes said.\n\nThe city recently started implementation of a three-year strategic plan with an emphasis on social equity with the goal of improving the odds of financial and educational success for everyone. The plan was born out of a brainstorming session among city staff, during which city leaders placed an emphasis on the widening gap between the “two Columbias” — those who have money and those who are in poverty.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s meeting, Matthes went into detail about what is expected of a team of individuals recently hired to help with the strategic plan. The city hired former Imani Mission Center co-founders Glenn Cobbins and Judy Hubbard, University of Missouri adjunct instructor Carl Kenney and Columbia Board of Education President James Whitt to help facilitate social change in Columbia.\n\nMatthes said Whitt is collecting a list of minority-owned businesses with information such as how many employees they have and how many are a certified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise — a federal designation given to businesses operated by minorities and women. He said the city will use the list of businesses to proactively select them for contracts, even if it is something as small as catering.\n\nMatthes also said the city is working to get more people involved in its entrepreneurial programs and is training more of its employees to be certified in diversity hiring.\n\nMatthes and Race Matters clashed over how city leaders handle competing special interests when making policies and decisions.\n\nMatthes said when he or the Columbia City Council makes a decision, it often becomes very political. He said leaders have to balance various competing interests throughout the community.\n\n“When we move away from that, there are people who are worried their interests are being ignored,” Matthes said.\n\nRace Matters member Traci Wilson-Kleekamp said the balancing leaders engage in is an example of a systemic issue the group has been trying to address. She said powerful interests in the city are still at the front of the line, despite the city’s equity policies.\n\nWilson-Kleekamp pointed to three neighborhoods the city plans to focus its strategic plan efforts on. She said the reason neighborhoods end up in poor situations is because city policy has favored more advantaged residents.\n\n“We have to be willing to address how those neighborhoods got to that place, and fixing them doesn’t mean others have to lose,” Wilson-Kleekamp said.\n\nMatthes said with pushback from some segments of the community, changes on the policy level are slow.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Matthes invited the group to speak with city staff about social equity.\n\nWilson-Kleekamp said the group accepted the invitation and challenged the city manager to complete training on race issues."

   "ARTICLE": "For anyone who’s had any experience with roll carts, the robust opposition in Columbia to this superior form of trash collection is baffling.\n\nAn obstructionist organization with a decidedly wannabe acronym of SWAG — Solid Waste Advocacy Group — has gone so far as to get the issue on Tuesday’s ballot here, hoping to prevent the city from implementing a program centered on wheeled trash bins for at least six months.\n\nIn a bit of counterintuitive ballot language that no doubt will be confusing to some, a “yes” vote means you’re on SWAG’s side, signifying you don’t want the carts, while a “no” vote means you do.\n\nIn fighting the bins, SWAG and its supporters are reaching with such spurious claims as them being unsightly and too difficult to wheel through the snow — oh, those harsh winters we’ve had in Mid-Missouri — ignoring the obvious upside of them being safer, cleaner and, in the long run, cost-saving for the community.\n\nSWAG is also missing out on the big plus — the opportunity to develop the next champion in the Garbage Can World Cup.\n\nInformation is a little sketchy on if the street-luge-like downhill dustbin race is still taking place in Germany, but why not be ready to put two-time champ Norman Schaefer out to the curb the next time the wheelie-bin competition comes around?\n\nThis could be your Waste Management Olympic moment, Columbia.\n\nDon’t just sloppily bag that up and throw it away."

   "ARTICLE": "Chelsea Clinton was 12 when her father, Bill Clinton, was sworn in as president in 1993. At a campaign stop Monday in Columbia for her mother’s candidacy for the same office, she recalled that Republican commentators began insulting her before the family arrived in Washington.\n\n“A Republican commentator said they were bringing a cat to the White House, Socks, but they were also bringing their dog, Chelsea,” she said to reporters at the UCP Heartland Child Development Center, 3804 Santiago Drive.\n\nHer parents helped her understand those insults were more about the person making them than about her, Clinton said. But the same kind of language becoming common from candidates such as Republican front-runner Donald Trump is steering political discourse into dangerous territory, she said.\n\n“The larger challenge that should concern all of us as Americans is, frankly, the normalization of hate speech coming out of the Republican side,” Clinton said. “The racism, the sexism, the Islamophobia, the anti-immigrant rhetoric, things that are said about Americans with disabilities, the homophobia, and we just have to make it clear that there is no place for that in our country.”\n\nClinton was in Columbia as part of four Missouri stops ahead of Tuesday’s primary. Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, is seeking to stave off an unexpectedly strong challenge for the Democratic nomination from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and holds a slim lead in a poll conducted last week for the Tribune and nine other newspapers.\n\nAlong with Missouri, there will be Democratic primaries Tuesday in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nA sweep by Clinton could seal the nomination for her while a sweep by Sanders would prolong the contest into April and perhaps later.\n\nThe visit did not violate UCP’s tax-exempt status, which bans partisan political activity, Richard Forkosh, president and CEO of UCP Heartland wrote in an email to the Tribune.\n\n“It was presented to us as a private tour to learn about what we are doing in inclusive early childhood education services and to share this information in a private setting,” he wrote. “This event is not open to the public!”\n\nThe event was announced by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and drew about 50 people. Drew Pusateri, spokesman for the campaign, declined to comment on whether the visit created issues for the organizations’ tax-exempt status.\n\nDuring the event, Clinton at several points pointed to her mother’s record or campaign promises as the best choice for parents.\n\n“What she is campaigning for in this election is to ensure that we have paid maternity and paternity leave and family medical leave more broadly,” Clinton said.\n\nHer mother worked to implement the Children’s Health Insurance Program and supports child care tax credits, universal pre-kindergarten and more federal support for K-12 education, she said.\n\n“She is the only candidate on either side of the aisle who tells you exactly how she is going to pay for everything,” Clinton said. “We need a president who understands how to do that, because Republicans control Congress and that is not expected to change. We need a president who knows how to build coalitions around our most important issues.”"

   "ARTICLE": "Barry and Marge Slayton’s time at the University of Missouri taught them to be willing to adapt to whatever happens in their careers, and the couple wanted to give back to the institution that helped them succeed.\n\nOn Friday, the Slaytons and officials said the couple had given $2.65 million from their estate to support beef genomics and nutrition research at MU. The Slaytons’ gift will go toward research into improving the nutrition of cattle and reproduction practices used on beef farms as well as help fund undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships, said Thomas Payne, vice chancellor and dean of the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources.\n\n“The work they’re doing helps us better identify genetics that we can use to mark animals or identify animals and breed them better and produce better and stronger versions and increase the value in the state,” Payne said of researchers during an event to publicize the gift at Jesse Hall.\n\nThe Slaytons’ contribution will enhance an MU animal sciences program that is ranked among the best in the world, Payne said. Barry Slayton has an interest in beef genetics and his wife is interested in nutrition.\n\n“Genetics is on the cutting edge now,” Barry Slayton said. “That really intrigues me from that standpoint and we just thought that would be a good way to combine our gift, cover both areas of focus and do the most good.”\n\nMarge and Barry Slayton met at MU and both hold degrees from the university. They live on a 1,000-acre farm with about 100 head of cattle in West Plains.\n\nThe donation is the second announcement in as many days about the university securing funding for research in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources. Gov. Jay Nixon appeared with Payne and other officials Thursday at the Bradford Research Center as they revealed the college won a $4.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study how drought affects corn and other plants.\n\nOn Thursday the Missouri House approved a bill that would cut $8.6 million from the UM System budget; $1 million of that total would come from the MU budget. Some legislators have been critical of the university’s response to unrest in November that led to the resignation of then-System President Tim Wolfe, using the events to justify efforts to reduce the university’s state funding.\n\nPayne said the donation comes at an important time for MU and the state of Missouri."

   "ARTICLE": "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wants to tap into voter anger at a Congress that hasn’t lived up to its promises and a president who has overreached executive authority, his wife Heidi Cruz told supporters Friday in Columbia.\n\nIn a brief campaign stop at Dickey’s Barbecue Pit, Heidi Cruz took aim both at the Republican-led Congress and President Barack Obama, a Democrat.\n\n“There’s an anger among the American people for electing people over and over who have great talking points but don’t do what they say they are going to do,” Cruz told reporters.\n\nA poll for 10 Missouri newspapers including the Tribune, released Friday, showed her husband to be trailing businessman Donald Trump in the state by a 36-29 margin among likely Republican voters in Tuesday’s primary. The two other contenders in the race, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, each received the support of less than 10 percent of those polled.\n\nCruz did the best in theoretical fall match-ups with the Democratic contenders, with a 9-point lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders and a 17-point lead over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nMissouri will be one of five states holding primaries Tuesday and the winner in each congressional district is awarded five delegates, with nine going to the statewide winner. If one candidate receives a majority of the statewide vote they will win all 49 delegates up for grabs.\n\nLocally, Cruz’s campaign has outspent Trump, buying $44,680 worth of television time in Central Missouri to $18,750 for Trump. Rubio and Kasich are focused on their home states. Club for Growth Action has also spent $57,790 on ads opposing Trump.\n\nCruz’s campaign is counting on doing well in the state, in part because his chief strategist, Jeff Roe of Axiom Strategies, made his reputation in Missouri. “It brings a certain expectation that you would win Missouri,” said Jerry Dowell, director of government affairs for the Columbia Chamber of Commerce. Dowell, speaking for himself and not the chamber, said he supports Cruz.\n\nHeidi Cruz made a short speech to about 75 people overflowing the small room where volunteers have worked to call and motivate voters to support her husband. She addressed some of the criticism of her husband — that he is not well liked in the U.S. Senate and that he has led crusades against Obama’s policies that have hurt the party’s image.\n\nOnce elected, she said, the Republican-led Congress will have to work with her husband.\n\n“This inept Congress will have to act,” Heidi Cruz said. “The same people who elect the president elect our Congress and our senators.”\n\nThe supporters who came out to hear Cruz and get their pictures taken with her included two young girls, Elizabeth and Caroline Petersen, 9 and 10 respectively, and World War II veteran A.J. Hayes, who will turn 90 in August.\n\n“I think he would be a good president and follow the constitution,” Elizabeth said.\n\nHayes cast his first vote for Harry Truman in 1948 after he returned from Japan, he said. While he will vote for Ted Cruz on Tuesday, Hayes said, he thinks politics have fallen in tone since that era.\n\n“Now we don’t have a Republican and Democratic party like we used to have,” he said. “They are not the same.”\n\nTed Cruz is in his first term in the U.S. Senate and never held elective office before winning the seat in 2012. He has the same amount of experience in federal office as Obama did when he won the presidency in 2008. Heidi Cruz said the comparison ends there.\n\n“The reason that Obama has been an unmitigated disaster for this country as our president is not because he was a first-term senator,” she said. “It is because he is an unapologetic socialist trying to run a country that is majority conservative.”"

   "ARTICLE": "Amid controversy surrounding the University of Missouri and the General Assembly’s barrage of budget cuts to the UM System, Gov. Jay Nixon visited Columbia on Thursday as he and other officials touted a $4.2 million grant the MU Interdisciplinary Plant Group received to fund crop research.\n\nShortly after a tour and roundtable discussion with students and the leaders of the project at the Bradford Research Center, 4968 S. Rangeline Road, Nixon fielded questions from reporters. He said he hopes the Senate will restore a $56 million increase in higher education funding included in his 2017 budget draft that House lawmakers cut by $8.6 million.\n\n“I’m disappointed that they’re not joining us in working together to keep tuition down, move this state forward and improve the opportunity for higher education,” Nixon said. “That’s so important.”\n\nDuring the 2016 legislative session, which began in January, lawmakers have sought to punish the UM System’s flagship campus for unrest that spurred the November resignations of UM System President Tim Wolfe and MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin.\n\nStudent group Concerned Student 1950 brought international attention to MU through demonstrations over racism on campus that sought Wolfe’s ouster. At the same time, faculty members and deans called for Loftin’s dismissal and said he created a “toxic environment through threat, fear and intimidation.”\n\nSome legislators and other politicians have been critical of the university’s response to the November protests.\n\nThe Missouri House on Thursday approved a higher education spending bill that would cut $8.6 million in funding to the UM System, taking $1 million from MU and $7.6 million from system administration. The bill has been sent to the Senate.\n\nNixon said he thinks interim UM System President Mike Middleton and his staff have done a good job. Asked whether the unrest and its aftermath have hurt MU’s image, Nixon said Middleton and officials are “doing a lot of things to address those challenges.” He deflected a question about whether he is concerned about a projected decrease of 1,500 students at the Columbia campus.\n\n“Students from around the world are choosing” MU, Nixon said. “Faculty members from around the world are choosing the Show-Me State for their careers. … We shouldn’t have a bad week in November slow down the significant progress that this institution and higher education in the Show-Me State are making.”\n\nThe governor appeared alongside Middleton and several other university officials at the research center to announce the $4.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation. Changes in climate and precipitation in the world over the past few decades have made it difficult to grow enough food to feed the Earth’s population, Nixon said. Students and faculty who specialize in plant sciences, biochemistry, biological sciences, computer science and journalism will collaborate on the research project, which will study how the roots of some plants respond to drought conditions.\n\n“The goal is really to understand, get a much more detailed comprehensive understanding of how root growth adapts to drought,” said Robert Sharp, a professor of agronomy at MU and director of the interdisciplinary plant group.\n\nDrought has the largest effect on crop yields worldwide, he said, and the four-year project will examine the roots of plants such as wheat, corn and sorghum in simulated drought conditions.\n\n“The work we do should be fundamentally important to helping crop performance in drought both in Missouri and globally,” Sharp said."

   "ARTICLE": "One could accurately call him the comeback kid.\n\nKael Miranda, 11, who finished second during the 2014 Columbia Daily Tribune Regional Spelling Bee, on Tuesday recovered from a disappointing performance in 2015 to win the regional bee.\n\nThe sixth-grader at Lange Middle School correctly spelled “cataclysmic” and the final word, “trachea,” to seal the championship. As the regional champion, Kael will compete in the Scripps National Spelling Bee on May 22-27 in National Harbor, Md.\n\n“Everyone’s going to be so happy at school,” Kael said after winning, surrounded by his parents and siblings.\n\n“His school is so proud of him,” said his mom, Maria Miranda.\n\nEach time his turn at the microphone arrived, Kael confidently rushed to the front of the stage at Christian Fellowship Church, presumably eager for the challenge of the next word.\n\nKael’s dad, Dominic Miranda, said Kael was overconfident last year and didn’t study as much.\n\n“He really buckled down this year and studied two to four hours a day,” Dominic Miranda said.\n\nDominic Miranda said the spelling bee is a crazy event and that “there’s a lot of pressure as a parent out there” in the audience.\n\n“I think all the kids persevered very well against an incredible amount of pressure,” he said.\n\nIt was Kael’s third appearance in the regional spelling bee.\n\nPranav Barla, a fifth-grader at Columbia Independent School, finished in second place, stumbling on the word “manacle.”\n\nPranav also was celebrating his 11th birthday. Pranav congratulated Kael on his win and said he was proud of everyone who participated in the spelling bee.\n\nHe also thanked his parents and grandparents for their help in getting him to the bee. His parents, grandparents and sister were in the audience and joined him at the end.\n\n“I feel good,” Pranav said. “I tried my best this year. I’d like to win next year.”\n\nIsabel Trindade, from Smithton Middle School, came in third place after misspelling “lumen.” A few rounds earlier, she had a chance to win after Kael and Pranav both missed a word. She was unable to correctly spell “battalion,” so the competition continued.\n\nThere was some confusion at the judges’ table at points during the bee. When Ridgeway Elementary School student Aashish Gadicherla misspelled “retina” and was eliminated, an audience member challenged the pronunciation the student was given. Judge Vicki Russell, Tribune publisher, ruled the pronunciation correct based on an official pronunciation guide.\n\nAnother audience member appealed the elimination, arguing that the judges switched to a list of more difficult words in the middle of the round. Russell upheld the appeal and allowed Aashish to return to the competition. Aashish missed the next word he was given.\n\nThe bee spanned 23 rounds and lasted a little more than three hours. Spellers faced a varied assortment of words Tuesday, including “adjudication,” “centaur,” “schadenfreude,” “intaglio” and “Anschluss.”\n\nKael’s family went to a local restaurant for dinner Tuesday night to celebrate his victory."

   "ARTICLE": "Demonstrators with Concerned Student 1950 on Monday encountered a locked door at University of Missouri interim Chancellor Hank Foley’s office and had an impromptu meeting with interim Vice Chancellor Chuck Henson cut short after a message was whispered in his ear.\n\nWith Academy Award-winning director Spike Lee filming for ESPN, the demonstrators marched from the Gaines/Oldham Black Culture Center to Jesse Hall, passing through the MU Student Center and Memorial Union along the way.\n\n“A lot of people don’t see that we are trying to reach out, and they shut the door on us all the time,” said Imani Simmons-Elloie, a member of Concerned Student 1950, after the demonstration. “We’re the black kids that are crying wolf to everybody else.”\n\nThe demonstration was sparked in part by a Feb. 25 letter from Henson, interim vice chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity, that said Concerned Student 1950 members had not responded to invitations to meet. In his letter, Henson said a working group of faculty, staff and students was the proper venue to deal with race issues.\n\nIn a video statement released late Monday afternoon, Henson defended the working group’s activities.\n\n“The working group is working,” Henson said. “And the protest that happened on our campus today was unfair and might leave the wrong impression about the amount of progress that we have made and the climate on our campus today.”\n\nDemonstrations by Concerned Student 1950 in the fall put MU in an international spotlight when graduate student Jonathan Butler engaged in a hunger strike and the Missouri football team announced a boycott of athletic activities in support of the students’ demands. UM System President Tim Wolfe resigned Nov. 9, and Henson, a law professor, was named vice chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity shortly thereafter.\n\nButler wrote Monday on Twitter that he is “no longer affiliated or organizing” with Concerned Student 1950. He said he has not organized with the group since November.\n\nThe administration’s handling of the protests and other turmoil at MU contributed to legislative plans to cut the UM System budget by about $7.6 million. The budget bill enacting the cuts will be debated this week in the Missouri House.\n\nDuring the march Monday, the demonstrators — about three dozen in all — chanted “The working group ain’t working” and “If we don’t get it, shut it down.” They told Henson the working group “is you telling us what you want us to do.”\n\nIn Jesse Hall, the group chanted “Hey Foley! You in there?” before discovering the door to the interim chancellor’s office was locked. Henson emerged from his upstairs office to meet with the demonstrators and tried to explain the activities of the working group, which he said has met three times since its formation.\n\nHe was met with skepticism and returned to his office after an aide whispered in his ear.\n\nMarshall Allen, a founding member of Concerned Student 1950, said Henson’s decision to leave the conversation was disrespectful.\n\n“If I were talking to you right now and you just stopped and walked away, you are not interested in what I have to say whatsoever,” he said.\n\nIn his video statement, Henson said the university is “dealing with issues that took more than 100 years to develop here and are certainly going to take more than 100 days and three meetings to address.”\n\nMU spokeswoman Mary Jo Banken did not offer an explanation for why Foley’s door was locked or why Henson was called away from the hallway discussion.\n\nLee declined to speak with reporters about his film project. He produces “Spike Lee’s Lil’ Joints,” a series of short films for ESPN Films. The documentary about Concerned Student 1950, titled “2 Fists Up,” will be released May 31, the network said in an email.\n\nLee’s presence was not the reason for the demonstration Monday, Allen said. Lee has tried to understand the roots of students’ frustrations and what led to the fall demonstrations, Allen said.\n\n“We appreciate the fact that we have people who want to come and know the truth,” he said."

Are there any secret treasures out there, quietly delivering the goods while the spotlight falls elsewhere?\n\nThe trouble is, one person's hidden gem is another's back yard.\n                \nAnd if it's still hidden now, in 2016, can it really be much of a gem?\n\nOnly one way to find out -- get on the road and explore.\n\nOr two, if you count reading our guide to 10 of the best European resorts you may not have heard of.\n\n1. Val d'Anniviers (Switzerland)\n\nWhy? Quiet valley, traditional villages, famous high mountains, extended ski area.\n\nThe Val d'Anniviers is a sideshoot of the broad Rhone valley and an unknown backwater compared to its Valais neighbors -- and international giants -- Zermatt and Verbier.\n\nHome to five small unspoilt resorts, the area is gaining recognition thanks to the recent cable car link between the two biggest, Grimentz and Zinal.\n\nIt's a secret powder haven offering more than 100 kilometers of sunny cruising.\n\nThe pretty Valais village of Zinal (1,670 meters) is hemmed in at the head of the valley by what's known as the Imperial Crown -- legendary peaks such as the Matterhorn, Weisshorn, Zinalrothorn, Obergabelhorn and Dent Blanche, all towering over 4,000 meters.\n\nGrimentz, five miles down the hill, is an old-school charmer with blackened wooden chalets and traditional barns (raccards) and cowsheds.\n\nThe separate, but linked, villages of St-Luc and Chandolin offer a further 60 kilometers of skiing, but no one's coming here to break the odometer.\n\nWhat else? Like a Swiss cheese riddled with holes, the Zinal glacier has caves and grottoes aplenty and visitors can strap on some snow shoes and take a hike right into its icy depths.\n\n2. Champoluc (Italy)\n\nWhy? Unsung Italian charm, access to Alagna's revered backcountry, Matterhorn views, cheap.\n\nNeighboring Alagna and Gressoney-la-Trinite have been fixtures with the Euro freeride fraternity for some time, but cosy Champoluc is often overlooked.\n\nThe westernmost valley of the Monterosa ski area -- with 180 kilometers of groomed runs -- is only an hour by road from Turin but offers an amiable Italian backwater off the main Aosta Valley.\n\nChampoluc's ideal-for-intermediates ski area links over to Gressoney and Alagna, where the experts go to ride the Indren lift up to 3,275 meters for extensive off-piste runs on the southern flanks of the Monte Rosa massif, western Europe's second highest range.\n\nChampoluc's a quiet sort of place, ideal for making your own fun in the smattering of honest local joints.\n\nAnd it's cheap -- 1 euro ($1) for a coffee anyone?\n\nWhat else? Hiding in the forest just above town is Bruno's Bar, an atmospheric little shack for a final slurp before the ski patrol sweeps everyone down the hill at 5 p.m.\n\nCutesy Antagnod just down the valley has old wooden barns and some characterful eateries.\n\n3. Warth-Schrocken (Austria)\n\nWhy? Time-warped village, quiet slopes, bumper snowfall, links into Arlberg ski area.\n\nThe Arlberg is an Austrian icon -- vast, characterful, snow-filled and home to such international sparklers as St. Anton, Lech and Zurs.\n\nBut close inspection reveals another treasure waiting to be dusted off -- Warth, the shy but talented sibling finally getting its chance to shine.\n\nThis unheralded, traditional village -- first settled in the 11th century by Walser people from the Swiss canton Wallis (or Valais) -- offers good value for money and quiet slopes away from the rat runs of the Arlberg.\n\nThe genius part is the two-kilometer Auenfeldjet gondola which now links time-warped Warth with luxurious Lech -- that's 350 kilometers of groomed runs and 97 lifts and cableways.\n\nWhat else? A planned new lift for 2017 from Zurs to Stuben will remove the final weak link in the Arlberg system -- the bus -- adding further luster to Warth's shine.\n\n4. Sainte Foy (France)\n\nWhy? A haven from mega-resort madness, family-friendly, off-piste mecca.\n\nThis Tarentaise treat was once the cult powder preserve of instructors and guides on days off from Val d'Isere and Tignes, but now little Sainte Foy has flourished into a decent all-rounder for those seeking a quieter life.\n\nThe ski area rises from 1,550 meters to 2,620 meters and only has four lifts, but the characterful runs offer family-friendly fun.\n\nAnd the off-piste is still fabled.\n\nBefriend a guide and take a heart-pounding plunge down the pristine powder fields of La Foglietta or brave a leg-jellying descent to the historic hamlet of Le Monal for a memorable big day.\n\nThose really missig the thump of a disco or the push and shove of a good French lift line, \"Val,\" Tignes, Les Arcs and La Plagne are just up/down the road.\n\nWhat else? For a taste of the old Tarentaise, La Bergerie on the slopes offers wood-clad Savoyard styling and specialties with fondues, raclettes, tartiflettes and croziflettes featuring strongly.\n\nThat's a lot of cheese.\n\n5. Hochkoenig (Austria)\n\nWhy? Extensive cruising, tree-lined skiing, Austrian atmosphere, choice of villages, sweeping views.\n\nHochkoenig is the highest mountain in the Berchtesgaden Alps (2,941 meters) and the name of an untapped intermediate goldmine of a resort 80 kilometers south of Salzburg.\n\nDraped across the corrugated crumples from charming Maria Alm to Mulhbach, via the hamlets of Hinterthal and Dienten, lies 120 kilometers of perfect pottering on largely tree-lined slopes, handy for those can't-see-the-end-of-my-nose, which-way-is-down days.\n\nFor enthusiasts looking to log some miles -- the Konigstour is a 32-kilometer romp over five summits and features 6,700 meters of ups and downs.\n\nSki huts ranging from rustic to trendy are all keen to peddle local produce and specialties.\n\nMmm, roast pork with dumplings and sauerkraut followed by Kaiserschmarrn pancakes with stewed plums, please.\n\nWhat else? Soak up the last of the sun's rays at one of Hochkoenig's \"sundowner\" huts -- each night a different venue will host you for drinks and eats before sliding back home with headlamps down specified slopes that stay open until 10 p.m.\n\n6. Andermatt (Switzerland)\n\nWhy? Old-school favorite with a facelift, new lift connections planned, off-piste paradise.\n\nSleepy Andermatt is going through a renaissance.\n\nThe pretty-in-places old town had rather fallen out of favor since the 80s for failing to upgrade its infrastructure.\n\nThose who did come -- Scandinavians, mostly -- were drawn by the fabled Gemsstock mountain, 2,961 meters of north-facing fun and an adventurous skier's dream.\n\nBut Andermatt is undergoing a $1.8 billion facelift by Egyptian property developer Samih Sawiris.\n\nSwanky hotels -- the Chedi Andermatt is the centerpiece -- chalets, apartments, a leisure center and golf course will nearly double the size of the town and bring it into the 21st century.\n\nThe linking of the Natschen ski area with Sedrun across the Oberalp Pass by 2017 will stretch the pistes to 120 kilometers.\n\nThe little red train up the hill -- the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn -- is almost a selling point in itself.\n\nWhat else? Skiers can follow in the trails of Andermatt's finest son and take the 4.3-kilometer run named after 1972 Olympic downhill champion Bernhard Russi from Gemsstock via the Gurschen glacier to the Gurschenalp, nearly 1,000 meters below.\n\n7. Pralognan-la-Vanoise (France)\n\nWhy? Authentic village, rich mountain culture, high alpine splendor, modern agenda.\n\nWhat Pralognan lacks in mileage compared to the nearby megalopolis of Les Trois Vallees, it makes up for in Savoyard soul.\n\nHiding at the end of a steep-sided valley under the imposing 3,855-meter Grand Casse, pretty Pralognan is an authentic Savoie village -- unlike the purpose-built bling of nearby Courchevel -- at the heart of the Vanoise National Park.\n\nThe compact ski area rises from 1,410 meters to 2,355 meters and offers 26 kilometers of groomed slopes and 12 lifts.\n\nFor the energetic, Pralognan is prime Nordic and ski touring territory onto the Glaciers de la Vanoise.\n\nBudding skips and sweepers can try out the curling venue from the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics.\n\nWhat else? It's possible to tap into the Savoyard source -- not by drinking the local firewater -- but by riding the Genepi chairlift to the rustic Refuge des Balmettes, a cozy mountain restaurant at 2,010 meters with lodging for a night high up among the peaks and plunging valleys of the Vanoise.\n\n8. Serfaus (Austria)\n\nWhy? Under-rated ski area, traffic-free town, Tyrolean charm.\n\nSerfaus is an amiable spot sitting on a sunny shelf it shares with sister resorts Fiss and Ladis above the Inn valley in the Tyrol region of Austria.\n\nBetween the three villages are 212 kilometers of pistes offering a decent selection of runs for varying standards stretching from 1,200 meters to as high as 2,820 meters at the summit of the Masnerkopf.\n\nSerfaus is largely traffic-free thanks to the Dorfbahn, an air-cushioned underground railway that runs from one end of town to the main cable-car station at the other.\n\nIt's as Austrian as they come and visitors are unlikely to bump into anyone from their hometown.\n\nWhat else? Worried skiing is a bit too, well, ground-based?\nIt's possible to get airborne and reach speeds of 65 kph over the heads of skiers on the Serfauser Sauser, a zip-wire that travels for 2,000 meters and plunges 400 meters.\n\n9. Baqueira-Beret (Spain)\n\nWhy? Spanish skiing's El Dorado, surprising snow, good value accommodation, royal connections, tapas on tap.\n\nThis Pyrenean pearl has long been cherished by Spanish skiers, including the royal family, but the rest of us are only just waking up to its allure.\n\nLurking in those powder-filled folds between France and Spain is a decent-sized resort -- 150 kilometers of groomed slopes and 35 lifts -- with an outstanding snow record because of the Atlantic influence.\n\nThe main village of Baquiera lies at 1,500 meters in the Aran valley with the highest skiing at 2,500 meters above the hamlet of Beret.\nSpain offers a different take on apres-ski, but one that involves plenty of tapas-y treats.\n\n\"I'm a big fan. There's lots of bang for your bucks in terms of quality accommodation, top food at Spanish prices and a surprisingly good snow record,\" says Richard Lumb, co-owner of ski specialists Kaluma Travel.\n\nWhat else? Heli-skiing is relatively inexpensive -- two drops start from 290 euros ($315) or a full day with five drops is 795 euros ($864) per person with Pyrenees Heliski, based out of Vielha, a short drive away.\n\n10. Riksgransen (Sweden)\n\nWhy? Midnight sun, northern lights, bumper snowfall, world's most northerly ski resort.\n\nSkiing in daylight until well past bedtime? Possible at Riksgransen.\n\nToo much snow was once a big problem in these parts, 200 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, and in 1910 the town was closed down, the 500 inhabitants moved out and the shutters drawn.\n\nBut now the white stuff is pulling skiers back for a trip less ordinary in snow-lashed Lapland.\n\nThose making the trek -- a four-hour flight from Stockholm to Kiruna, plus two hours in car, bus or train -- will find six lifts, 29 runs and a whole big bunch of off-piste butting up to the Norwegian border.\n\nThe backcountry is what has regenerated Riksgransen, with 60 peaks in excess of 1,200 meters and 1 million acres of heli-skiing.\n\nWhat else? On selected dates in May it's possible to ski under the midnight sun, with lifts opening from 9.45 p.m. to 00.30 a.m. Or Sweden's famous ICEHOTEL is a short day trip away."

   "ARTICLE": "Fans of Denmark must be even happier than usual: Denmark has retaken the title of \"world's happiest country,\" knocking Switzerland into second place.\n\nDenmark and Switzerland were closely followed by Iceland, Norway and Finland, according to the World Happiness Report Update 2016, released Wednesday in Rome by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations.\n                \nDenmark won the title three of the four times the report has been issued, losing to Switzerland only once.\n\nPeople in Burundi are the least satisfied with their lives, according to the survey of 156 countries, but residents of Benin (153rd place), Afghanistan (154), Togo (155) and Syria (156) aren't doing much better.\n\nThe United States ranked 13th in overall happiness, lagging behind Canada (6), the Netherlands (7), New Zealand (8), Australia (9), Sweden (10), Israel (11) and Austria (12). Germany came in 16th place, while other superpowers -- the United Kingdom (23), Japan (53), Russia (56) and China (83) -- were markedly lower.\n\nSome countries that saw drops suffered economic and political turmoil -- including Greece, Italy and Spain -- while Ukraine's political trouble and violence likely caused a significant drop in happiness there.\n\nMeasuring happiness is important\n\nHappiness is a better measure of human welfare than measuring education, health, poverty, income and good government separately, the report's editors argue.\n\nThere are at least seven key ingredients of happiness: People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies, have more social support, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption, experience more generosity, experience less inequality of happiness and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows.\n\n\"Measuring self-reported happiness and achieving well-being should be on every nation's agenda as they begin to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the report's co-editor and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, in a statement.\n\n\"Indeed the goals themselves embody the very idea that human well-being should be nurtured through a holistic approach that combines economic, social and environmental objectives,\" Sachs said. \"Rather than taking a narrow approach focused solely on economic growth,we should promote societies that are prosperous, just, and environmentally sustainable.\"\n\nNot just about the money\n\nIceland and Ireland both suffered through banking crises that dramatically affected their economies but didn't greatly affect their happiness, according to the report. What both countries have is a high degree of social support, enough to put Iceland in third place and Ireland in 19th place this year, according to the report.\n\nStrictly focusing on financial well-being can obscure the larger picture, according to the University of British Columbia's John Helliwell.\n\n\"In Norway, it's quite common for people to paint each other's houses even though they can all afford to pay to have their houses painted,\" said Helliwell, a report co-editor and co-director of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.\n\n\"They go out of their way to help each other, and it becomes a social event, and those events are enormously supportive of well-being,\" Helliwell said. \"In the commercialization of activity -- when people are more likely to buy things than to do them for themselves and each other -- we lose something along the way.\"\n\nInequality of happiness\n\nIt turns out that people are also happier in countries where there's less inequality of well-being, the report found. And happiness inequality has increased significantly \"in most countries and regions of the world,\" said Helliwell, comparing 2012-15 data with 2005-11 data.\n\nThe country of Bhutan, a tiny country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, ranked No. 1 in happiness equality, followed by Comoros and the Netherlands. South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Liberia had the highest happiness inequality.\n\nA country may have really rich and really poor people, and the poor people don't have enough money to construct a good life for themselves, he said. Or people may have money but have no social support or friends, or live in an area where there's government corruption or lack of freedom to make their own life choices.\n\nThe birth of 'Gross National Happiness'\n\nIt's no surprise that Bhutan would come out on top, despite not being a world economic power: Its Prime Minister proposed a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011 and launched this international focus on happiness.\n\nFollowing in Bhutan's footsteps, the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012, recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world.\"\n\nIn recent years, other countries have made happiness a public policy goal of their governments. Bhutan, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela have all appointed \"Minsters of Happiness\" to focus on the happiness of their people."

   "ARTICLE": "India is undergoing a dramatic transformation.\n\nWith 10 million people flocking each year to its colorful, noisy and bustling cities, the country is facing the largest urban migration in history.\n\nAs the Asian giant's economy continues to flourish, places such as Kolkata, Chennai and Ahmedabad are creating unprecedented opportunities for their burgeoning workforces.\n\nBut beyond the numbers, what is life like in India's cities? We asked Instagrammers to give us an insider's guide, showing us the places, buildings and activities that make each city tick.\n\nWe've ventured beyond Mumbai and Delhi to five diverse corners of the Republic.\n\nThe kaleidoscope of stunning images reveals a changing India, where old and new are morphing to create an eclectic and fascinating landscape.\n\nLocated in the eastern corner of India, Kolkata is a vibrant metropolis of 4.5 million people. When taking in the 14 million residents of the surrounding area, it is India's third largest city after Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nAs Calcutta, it was India's capital during the British Raj and the base of the East India Company, which built the city's port, opening up lucrative commodity routes between India, China and Europe.\n\nToday Kolkata has become a major hub for IT firms, based in Bidhannagar -- a satellite town built in the 1960s. Nicknamed \"Salt Lake City\", it was constructed on a reclaimed salt lake -- the road to which can be seen in Rakesh Kumar Das's beautifully minimalist Instagram.\n\nKolkata's New Town houses India's largest football stadium -- rival home teams East Bengal and Mohun Bagun are the country's most popular. Kolkatan Instagrammer Orijit Basu captured the city's unique football status with a perfectly-timed shot of a boy playing in Kolkata's old center.\n\n\"Cricket is the most popular game in India, but ... football is in the veins of Kolkata,\" said the 39 year-old. \"Sachin Tendulkar (a legendary Indian cricketer) and Lionel Messi are equally popular in this city!\"\n\nFrom the elegant criss-crossing of old tram tracks by rickshaws to the almost palpable scents of the vast flower market at Mallick Ghat -- we love the old romance of Kolkata reflected in these shots.\n\nThis city of 5.6 million people in the northwestern state of Gujarat, has a textile industry that rivals that of Mumbai and a substantial pharmaceutical sector. Designated to be one of Narendra Modi's \"smart cities\", plans to construct a metro are underway.\n\nAhmedabad’s beautifully-preserved old center, however, offers a peek into the past, with its “pols” — traditional Gujarati housing clusters of ornately-carved wooden buildings that accommodate between 10 and 50 families.\n\nAersh Ahmad, 29, is a pharmaceutical business owner who manages the group Instagram Ahmedabad. He lives in a pol in the city's historic center. \"People live in a very close society, where neighbors are very close to each other,\" he said. \"Everyone knows each other, eats together. If you leave your house unlocked it's ok. Gujarati people think everyone is their brother, even if they are strangers.\n\n\"There are a lot of corporate buildings, malls and multiplexes coming up in Ahmedabad, but they are preserving the old center.\"\n\nSpot a boy in the peeling yellow doorway of a pol in Yash Sheth's Instagram, and be mesmerized by Ahmad's shots of the city's kite festival. Don't miss the beautiful stepwell in nearby Adalaj -- built in the 15th century, villagers descended its five staircases to drink, wash and bathe.\n\nChennai, in the eastern state of Tamil Nadu, is one of India's major economic and cultural hubs. Known as \"the Detroit of India\" for its automobile industry, the city also boasts thriving IT, finance and healthcare sectors, and one of India's oldest museums.\n\nThe 13km Marina Beach and the 7th century Mahabalipuram temple make Chennai a tourist hotspot. Last year it was chosen by Lonely Planet as one of the top 10 cities in the world to visit, and a sleek new metro opens in June.\n\nIndulge in the city's famed curries or escape its madness in Kovalam, a fishing village on the road to Mahabalipuram, which is famed for its surfing school. In the city center, you can find tranquility Elliot's Beach, and look out to the futuristic estuary, as snapped by Infant Clinton.\n\nChennai's Instagrammers were quick to show off the city's colonial and ancient architecture -- from the brightly-hued Kalapeeshwarar Temple captured by Farhad Behrana, to GV Balasubramanian's detailed photo of the annual Car Festival at the 8th century Parthasaray Temple dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu.\n\n\"The deity is brought to a chariot, a massive structure, which people pull by hand through all the streets surrounding the temple,\" explained Balasubramnian, a retired technical engineer. \"A lot of people come to witness it and ask for what they want -- it is believed that the God will grant it to them.\"\n\nCapital of the northern state of Rajasthan, Jaipur -- known as \"The Pink City\" -- was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh. Ahead of the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1786 (then George IV), his successor Maharaja Ram Singh II reportedly ordered for the city to be painted pink: the color of hospitality.\n\nToday, the city of 6.6 million people welcomes thousands of visitors as part of India's \"Golden Triangle\": Jaipur, Delhi and Agra's Taj Mahal. It's not hard to see why -- Singh was one of a line of Rajput Maharajas who controlled Rajasthan out of opulent palaces, notably the Amer Fort, 11km north of Jaipur. The stunning descent to the palace's lake can be admired in this Instagram by Holly Seidman, or the labyrinth of rust-colored walls shot by Gursimran Basra.\n\nFurthermore, the city's Hawa Mahal has an ornate façade of 953 windows, to allow royal Rajasthani ladies a protected view of the street, while the Jal Mahal is a heart-stoppingly romantic palace, atop a 300 acre lake.\n\nAn hour's drive towards Agra, Chand Baori is one of India's deepest and most stunning stepwells. Its 3,500 narrow steps are captured beautifully by Instagram's famous travel couple, Nataly and Murad Osmann.\n\nJaipur is also known for its handmade jewellery and crafts, and its delicious cuisine -- nutty, syrupy sweets and spiced dhal with bati, wheat rolls.\n\nVaranasi, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, is the holiest of seven sacred Hindu sites in India, and said to be the founding place of Buddhism, making it a destination for thousands of pilgrims and tourists.\n\nHome to 3.6 million people, Varanasi is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Running through its heart is the river Ganga, worshipped as a Hindu goddess and central to residents' washing, fishing and transport activities, as well as sacred ceremonies.\n\nGursimran Basra's powerful Instagrams capture the Ganges' significance, from the daily Ganga Aarti blessing setting the riverbank ablaze, to an intimate family passage to a wedding on the opposite bank. One shot reveals a seller of paan, a traditional South Asian stimulant made from betel leaves and spices.\n\nThe 25 year-old business analyst says:\"Because of the holy Ganges, the traditional Hindu culture prevails here, which makes it different from other cities in India. People go to Varanasi to remove their sins and pay homage to the Hindu God -- there are cremations, there are lots of Sadhus (Hindu holy men) who sit there for days and days. It's a beautiful place to photograph."

   "ARTICLE": "Still one of the world's most vibrant cities despite astronomical living costs, it's no surprise London is the world's second most visited destination.\n\nSo what's the first?\n\nThe emphatic answer, says market researcher Euromonitor International, is Hong Kong.\n                \nAttracting an impressive 27.77 million international tourists in the space of a year, the Asian city outstripped London's popularity to the tune of 10 million people.\n\nThe influx, chiefly accounted for by mainland Chinese visitors, kept Hong Kong at the forefront of Euromonitor's annual Top 100 City Destinations survey for the fifth year in succession.\n\nLondon, which last crowned the list in 2009, pulled in a mere 17.38 million, just ahead of Singapore at 17.09 million.\n\nEuromonitor's list is compiled from data from 57 \"core\" countries, using national statistics and info from airports, hotels and other tourism industry sources.\n\nThe company says the latest figures, from 2014, show geopolitical tensions and successful marketing campaigns swaying tourist decisions.\n\nFluctuating fortunes\n\nBut despite fluctuating fortunes for some key destinations, it says tourism remains an upward trend with all but a few cities improving on visitor numbers.\n\nThat said, Euromonitor warns of interesting times ahead for some of the main players.\n\nIt says Hong Kong's reliance on Chinese tourists is a weakness as their increasing affluence takes them further afield -- a situation likely to be exacerbated by recent protests there against mainland Chinese travelers.\n\nLondon's expensive reputation and the fact that its airports are nearing capacity could also see it losing out to European rivals, Euromonitor says.\n\nAs for Singapore, \"limited natural attractions\" and a reputation as a business rather than leisure destination could see it struggle to \"remain relevant\" against low-cost alternatives like Thailand.\nIstanbul, currently ranked ninth, is identified by Euromonitor as \"one to watch.\"\n\nIt says the city could build on a year-on-year increase of 13.2% although the emergent threat of ISIS could prove challenging."

   "ARTICLE": "From new attractions and massive additions to quirky flavors, big birthdays and booze, 2016 promises to be a good year for the curious traveler.\n\nHere are 16 spots and events across the United States worth checking out this year:\n                \nBoeing at 100, Seattle\n\nIt's Boeing's 100th birthday, and the independent Museum of Flight in Seattle (where the aerospace manufacturer was founded) has centennial plans spanning the whole year.\n\nIn late June, the museum is set to unveil a huge Aviation Pavilion, where a number of significant Boeing aircraft will be on display.\n\nThe 3-acre, $23 million space will house the first all-metal airliner, Boeing Model 247 from 1933, and the first all-composite airliner, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.\n\nAlso on view will be prototypes of the Boeing 727, 737 and 747 and the World War II-era B-17 and B-29.\n\nLight City Baltimore\n\nWhen the inaugural Light City Baltimore goes live, 28 light art installations will illuminate a 1.5-mile path along the city's Inner Harbor, with pop-up performances and musical acts adding to the festivities.\n\nOrganizers of the weeklong event, which runs March 28 through April 3, also hope to shine a light on their beloved city's creative and innovative communities.\n\nMost of the artists picked in a juried competition are locals, says Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts Executive Director Bill Gilmore, and much of their art reflects the social justice concerns of city residents.\n\nThe daytime Light City U will feature sessions focusing on sustainability, health care, education and the city's creative industries.\n\nAlaska's national parks\n\nIf you're seeking a spot where few have ever set foot, one of Alaska's 23 national parks may be a perfect fit.\n\nAnd 2016 is the right time to celebrate some of America's most pristine landscapes as the National Park Service marks its centennial in every state.\n\nAniakchak National Monument & Preserve, 450 miles southwest of Anchorage on the Alaska Peninsula, can't be reached by car, only by air or sea.\n\nHome to a 6-mile-wide, 2,500-foot-deep caldera, the site offers truly primitive camping, with no public park facilities available. Only 134 people visited in all of 2014.\n\nOpportunities for solitude are also excellent at Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, the largest national park at more than 13 million acres.\n\nAt home with Van Gogh, Chicago\n\nMore in the mood for intimacy than expansiveness? Vincent Van Gogh delivers.\n\nPerhaps the most famous bedroom in history, Van Gogh's room in Arles, France, is the subject of \"Van Gogh's Bedrooms,\" on view at the Art Institute of Chicago from February 14 through May 10.\n\nThe in-depth study of the artist's three paintings of the room, created between 1888 and 1889 and shown together for the first time in North America, is the first dedicated to this small corner of his life.\n\nThe exhibit features more than 30 works by the artist, all illuminating his exploration of home.\n\nCleveland\n\nThere's a lot going on in Cleveland: new hotels and restaurants, rejuvenation along the Cuyahoga River with The Flats East Bank development, a $32 million Public Square redesign and the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nBut what's got us really intrigued is the marriage of two great nutritional groups: beer and doughnuts.\n\nBrewnuts started as a beer-flavored doughnut venture and is about to become a flagship doughnut-themed bar where brews used in the baking will be available on draft. Of course, concoctions like maple bacon bourbon ale doughnuts will also be served fresh from the fryer.\n\nLocated in the Gordon Square Arts District of the trendy Detroit Shoreway neighborhood, the bar is expected to open in early spring.\n\nNational Blues Museum, St. Louis\n\nWhen the National Blues Museum in St. Louis opens in April, you'll be able to follow the historical migration of the blues and compare music from different regions at every turn.\n\n\"From the Mississippi Delta to Canada, every place has its own unique style,\" said Dion Brown, the museum's founding executive director.\n\nVisitors to the 23,000-square-foot museum can build their own blues riffs and learn how to play in a jug band. The museum's performance hall will host concerts, and artists will perform at the museum during the day.\n\nGreen Chile Cheeseburger Trail, New Mexico\n\nNew Mexico's Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail -- with nearly 100 spots to sample -- is a tasty way to add a little spice to your life this year.\n\nThough their exact origins are unknown, the distinctive burgers laden with cheese and green chiles have appeared on menus across the state since at least the 1950s.\n\nAt Sparky's in Hatch, a town defined by chiles, you can wash your burger down with a green chile shake.\n\nAt 5 Star Burgers -- a chain with locations in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Taos -- green chile mayo amps up the green chile cheeseburger experience.\n\nLexington, Kentucky\n\nThough known as a hotbed for bourbon and horses, Kentucky's second-largest city has branched out into craft beer and contemporary art.\n\n21c Museum Hotels is scheduled to open its fifth location in Lexington this spring, a sure sign that this city is putting a twist on tradition.\n\nHoused in downtown Lexington's historic Fayette National Bank Building, 21c Lexington will be a contemporary art museum, restaurant and boutique hotel in one.\n\nAnd visitors who vote beer over bourbon are in luck. The Brewgrass Trail traces the region's burgeoning craft beer movement with about a half-dozen stops in Lexington.\n\nSmithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington\n\nThe African-American experience will finally have a home within the nation's most prestigious collection of museums.\n\nAfter more than four years of construction, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture is scheduled to open this fall on a 5-acre tract near the Washington Monument.\n\nThe final above-ground museum slated for the National Mall, the 400,000-square-foot building will house an array of exhibits aimed at transcending \"the boundaries of race and culture that divide us.\"\n\nCurrently, the museum has a temporary gallery at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.\n\nCopa America Centenario, across the U.S.\n\nSoccer fans are eagerly anticipating June's Copa America Centenario, the centennial edition of the South American tournament, which is being held in the United States for the first time.\n\nFrom June 3 through June 26, 16 teams will play in 10 venues scattered across the U.S. from Boston to the Bay Area.\n\nThe U.S., Mexico, Brazil and Argentina will be the seeded teams. \n\nThe final match is scheduled for June 26 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nBuffalo, New York\n\nThe renaissance of the upstate New York town of Buffalo is due, in part, to its celebration of its past as a transportation hub and site of great architecture.\n\nThe western terminus of the Erie Canal is what's now called Canalside, an all-season entertainment district where you can ride ice bikes and skate during winter.\n\nOnce a feature of one of the world's largest grain ports, the enormous grain elevators dotting the area are inspiration for the Silo City performance art space and a nightly Canalside light show.\nFor architecture buffs, the $50 million restoration of Frank Lloyd Wright's Darwin Martin House Complex should be complete in the fall, and visitors can see more Wright work on upcoming \"All Wright All Day\" tours.\n\nAlso slated to open in 2016, the Hotel Henry will give the former Buffalo State Asylum new life as a boutique hotel.\n\nNot sure what to do first? Stop by local cafe Sweetness 7 and chat with owner Prish Moran, known as \"Buffamama\" to the locals.\n\nBarber Vintage Motorsports Museum, Birmingham, Alabama\n\nThe world's largest motorcycle collection is getting a bigger home.\nBarber Vintage Motorsports Museum -- home to more than 1,400 motorcycles -- is undergoing a $15 million expansion, adding 84,650 square feet to its existing 144,000-square-foot facility in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nThe expansion will allow the museum to display up to 1,000 motorcycles at a time as well as an expanded display of Lotus race cars. The expansion is expected to open in October.\n\nWizarding World of Harry Potter, Los Angeles\n\nThis spring, the West Coast will welcome its own Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\n\nThe wildly popular themed land, featuring the village of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is opening at Universal Studios Hollywood on April 7.\n\nOn its marquee ride, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, guests will wear Quidditch-inspired goggles to take advantage of its hyper-realistic 3D-HD technology.\n\nPasaquan, Buena Vista, Georgia\n\nHe called himself St. EOM and worked for three decades on a colorful art environment in his native Georgia.\n\nThe 7-acre site called Pasaquan is visionary self-taught artist Eddie Owens Martin's most extensive project, consisting of six major structures, hundreds of feet of colorfully painted masonry fence, totems, sculptures and other artifacts.\n\nRecently restored and turned over to Columbus State University, Pasaquan is set to open to visitors in 2016, with a soft-opening mid-year and a grand opening expected in October.\n\nAdmission will be $5 for adults.\n\nTennessee Whiskey Trail\n\nWith more than 30 distilleries across Tennessee, this state's whiskey culture has grown far beyond Jack Daniels and George Dickel. Seven newcomers opened last year, with five more distilleries planned for 2016.\n\nThe 4-year-old Tennessee Whiskey Trail helps visitors decide which spots to explore, including standouts such as Gatlinburg's Sugarlands Distilling Co. and Corsair Artisan Distillery in Nashville.\n\nTaste dozens of whiskeys in one place at the third annual Tennessee Whiskey Festival in May.\n\nThe elder statesman Jack Daniels Distillery in Lynchburg is marking its 150th anniversary this year. Take a sampling tour and look for echoes of Jack, who often ate lunch at the nearby Miss Mary Bobo's Boarding House.\n\nPearl Harbor at 75, Oahu\n\nDecember 7, 2016, marks 75 years since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II.\n\nTo mark the anniversary, the National WWII Museum has organized a seven-night educational tour from December 1 to December 8 in Hawaii.\n\nThe trip includes a four-part symposium on the events leading up to the attack and site visits led by historians.\n\nParticipants will also be guests at a ceremony at the USS Arizona commemorating the attacks. If booked by January 12, the trip is $8,750 for double occupancy ($8,995 after January 13)."

   "ARTICLE": "EGGS\n\nIt turns out the old adage is true — eggs really are cheaper by the dozen. According to Kiplinger.com, \"eggs at the supermarket tend to cost about 50 cents less per dozen than at a warehouse club.\" So forgo that 36-pack for the standard 12 and you'll actually be able to polish them off before they go bad in three to five weeks.\n\nSPICES\n\nWhile spices don't necessarily go bad, they do tend to lose their flavor pretty quickly. After about six months, ground spices will lose their potency, whereas spices in whole form (like cinnamon cloves) can last for up to a year.\n\nCONDIMENTS\n\nThis may be a shocker to many people, but that massive ketchup bottle you've had sitting in your fridge for years is probably *gasp* spoiled. With all of the preservatives packed into those hot dog-topping condiments you'd think they'd last, well, forever. Sadly, that's not the case.\n\nLIQUID BLEACH\n\nIt may seem like a smart item to buy in bulk, but liquid bleach actually only has a shelf life of about six months. If you want your whites to look fresh after every wash, opt to buying bleach in bulk when it's in powder form, which has an unlimited shelf life if stored in a cool, dry place.\n\nCOOKING OILS\n\nFrom frying to sauteing to roasting, almost every recipe you follow requires some kind of oil, whether it be olive or canola. Because you use these oils so often, it makes sense to buy them in bulk, right? Unfortunately, the answer is no. After three to six months, your cooking oils can begin to go rancid. In this case, smaller bottles are better.\n\nSKIN-CARE PRODUCTS\n\nWithin three to six months, that pricey face cream you purchased could begin to lose its effectiveness. Cue the wrinkles! To avoid this mishap, stick to smaller jars of skin-care products to reap their full benefits.\n\nCOFFEE BEANS\n\nIf you're the kind of person who absolutely needs a cup of coffee every morning to function, you may be tempted to buy coffee beans in bulk. But according to Eat This!, \"the freshest, best tasting cup of coffee is made from beans that have been roasted within two weeks of the cup being brought to your lips.\" So next time you want to heave that large bag o' beans over your shoulder and head for the cash register — think twice!\n\nSUNSCREEN\n\nMuch like face creams, sunscreen loses its effectiveness over time, especially when it's subjected to high temperatures found at the beach or poolside. Don't get burned just because you wanted to save a few bucks by buying in bulk!\n\nBROWN RICE AND WHOLE GRAINS\n\nDue to the fact that these foods are high in oil, it makes them very susceptible to spoilage. Only buy what you think you can polish off in six months, and make sure to store it in an airtight container in a cool place.\n\nBROWN RICE AND WHOLE GRAINS\n\nDue to the fact that these foods are high in oil, it makes them very susceptible to spoilage. Only buy what you think you can polish off in six months, and make sure to store it in an airtight container in a cool place.\n\nSODA\n\nYou may think you're getting a good deal on those crates of soda from Costco, but in actuality big-box stores bump up the price per can — but you can usually find great sales on soda at your local grocery store.\n\nBREAD\n\nWe all love our carbs, but unless you have a huge family to feed, chances are you aren't going to make it through all of that fluffy goodness before it starts to mold."

   "ARTICLE": "We know Lush likes to boast about all its products being totally natural and fresh, but it seems that's been taken very literally when it comes to one massage bar in particular.\n\nBecause the Wiccy Magic Muscles massage bar, designed to loosen up and ease achy muscles, has been causing PLANTS to grow in people's bathrooms. Seriously, look at this photo.\n\nAnd Rachel isn't the only one. This girl Hannah also reported the same thing happening. It's crazy.\n\nThe bar, made from a \"warming blend of cinnamon and peppermint essential oils,\" also contains aduki beans, which are said to help iron out any particularly stubborn knots. I've not got a clue what aduki beans are for, but a number of people now appear to be growing crops of them without even wanting to. It's bizarre.\n\nIt seems that the combination of warm temperatures, water, and the aduki beans are the perfect conditions for the beans to sprout. And it's quite sweet, really, if not also hugely annoying.\n\nHelen Ambrosen, co-founder of Lush, spoke to BuzzFeed about the continuing mishap. She said: \"We use organic aduki beans to create a texture in the massage bar, so that you've got small bead like shapes to massage the muscles.\n\n\"In order for the beans to germinate they must of been left in the shower for a few days. The results you get just go to show how fresh the ingredients really are.\"\n\nWell, yeah, that's one way to look at it.\n\nIronically, on Lush's website the Wiccy Magic Muscles bar comes with a warning, but it's got nothing to do with the fact that you might inadvertently start growing an allotment in your bathroom. Instead, the warning simply states that the bar is made with ingredients that might melt in hot weather. \n\nThink you need to get your priorities straight, Lush."

Then, I thought about it like this: Much like pre-blowout strands need heat protectant TLC, processed and damaged hair needs a shield of its own before cleansing — especially if it's colored. \n\n\"The majority of your color is lost by simply rinsing your hair with water in the shower,\" explains Eric Spengler, SVP of research and development at Living Proof. \"Even if you use a mild shampoo, you still lose more from the water rinse itself.\" \n\nThis is why Spengler, alongside the rest of his strand-safeguarding team, came up with their new Timeless Pre-Shampoo Treatment, which is formulated with color seal technology that insulates the hair before you even step into the shower. All you have to do is apply it to dry hair, spend five minutes scrolling through Instagram, and then hop in.\n\nWhat's more is that the powerhouse cream contains UV and thermal protectants to improve overall hair health. \"Damaged hair is more porous, and more porous hair loses color from rinsing more easily,\" says Spengler. \nBecause it prevents and corrects age-related damage in one fell swoop, the treatment is already being likened to retinol for hair. And what woman wouldn't want to ward off the mane equivalent of fine lines and wrinkles?\n\nBecause I bleach my hair blonde, do all sorts of crazy things to it, and want it to look good forever, I introduced the pre-shampoo step to my regimen on principle alone. It just made sense. Then, after one of my few-and-far-between washes, I noticed that my months-old color was less brassy than it should be. I'm sold."

   "ARTICLE": "Campaign ads for Gucci's latest cruise collection have been banned in the United Kingdom, Fashionista reports, following a ruling from the country's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). After the below video showcasing the campaign appeared on British newspaper The Times's website, the ASA received a complaint arguing that two models were \"unhealthily thin\":\n\nThe ASA's report notes the complaint related to two models: Madison Stubbington, pictured sitting on the couch in a yellow suit (above left), and Avery Blanchard, pictured leaning against a wall in a patterned dress (above right). \n\nIn their response, Gucci argued that \"the visual parts of [the models'] bodies appeared toned and slim,\" but not too slim. Whether a model is \"unhealthily thin\" or not, they continued, is a \"subjective matter.\" Read their argument in full below:\n\n\"The ads were part of a video that portrayed a dance party and was aimed at an older, sophisticated audience. They noted that the target population of The Times, where the ad appeared, had an adult and mature readership. They said it was, to some extent, a subjective issue as to whether a model looked unhealthily thin. which they considered was not the case for either of the women identified by the complainant. They believed both models had slim builds. but were not depicted in a way that could be interpreted as unhealthily thin. For example, nowhere in the ads were any models' \"bones\" visible, their makeup was natural rather than heavy (which might have accentuated the impression of thinness), lighting was uniform and warm to ensure there were no hollows caused by shadows and their clothes were not revealing. The visual parts of their bodies appeared toned and slim.\"\n\nRegardless, the ASA eventually ruled that Blanchard did appear too skinny in the campaign — \"her torso and arms were quite slender and appeared to be out of proportion with her head and lower body,\" their ruling read. \"Further, her pose elongated her torso and accentuated her waist so that it appeared to be very small...We also considered that her sombre facial expression and dark make up, particularly around her eyes, made her face look gaunt.\" Even if intended to combat problematic portrayals of the female form, it's worth noting this is a pretty body-shaming statement in itself.\n\nStill, this decision means the campaign now can't ever appear again in the U.K. \"in its current form\" (though, at this point, Gucci's moved past cruise season anyway). The ASA has also charged Gucci with acting more \"responsibly\" going forward.\n\nGet non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed. Follow Facebook.com/CosmoBeauty."

   "ARTICLE": "Students at Middlebury College in Vermont will have to rely on lots and lots of coffee during final exams from now on. That's because their campus has banned the sale of energy drinks, NBC News reports, and the reason why is surprising.\n\nOfficials on campus say the drinks are linked to \"problematic behavior\" since they're often mixed with alcohol. They say that making energy drinks available will contribute to \"high-risk sexual activity\" and drunk driving, among other decisions made under the influence. In fact, a 2012 study from the University of Buffalo found that college students who drank energy drinks mixed with alcohol were more likely to have drunken hookups or casual sex in general. However, the study didn't find any correlation between the drinks and unprotected sex; drinkers and nondrinkers alike were just as likely to use condoms. \n\nThe campus also presented research that the drinks contribute to an overall \"culture of stress\" and promote bad study habits. \"I see it as the equivalent of banning cigarettes,\" Dan Detora, the executive director of dining hall services, told NBC. He cited research showing that energy drinks can lead to poor heart health, liver health, and even seizures. \n\nAccording to the Middlebury Campus, the ban will start on March 7 and affect brands like Red Bull and 5-Hour Energy shots. The ban only applies to on-campus sales, so there's nothing stopping Middlebury students from buying cans off-campus and consuming them how they want. But it's a major blow for all-nighter study sessions in the library."

   "ARTICLE": "The University of Texas at Austin will allow anyone who has a license to carry a concealed handgun to take their weapons into classrooms, the school announced Wednesday. Texas recently passed a law that would allow people with a license to carry a concealed handgun to do so in public university buildings; the law gave colleges the power to create limited \"gun-free zones\" in certain areas, according to the Washington Post. The law goes into effect on August 1.\n\nThough every large private college in Texas has banned concealed carry on their campus, the public University of Texas cannot exercise that option. So the Austin campus, which had a vocal group of students and staffers who did not want concealed carry, set up a task force to figure out how best to uphold the new law.\n\n\"I do not believe handguns belong on a university campus, so this decision has been the greatest challenge of my presidency to date,\" university president Gregory L. Fenves wrote in a letter to students and staff. \"However, as president, I have an obligation to uphold the law.\"\n\nUnder UT Austin's new policy, people with a license to carry a concealed weapon must carry it in a holster, without a chambered round of ammunition. They can bring it to classrooms, but they cannot bring it to sporting events or science laboratories. Concealed handguns will be mostly banned in residence halls, except in common areas or if carried by a student's family members or dorm staffers.  According to the Dallas Morning News, the policy could be changed or even rejected by the larger University of Texas board. \n\nAs of 2015, there were 19 states that banned carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus. In 23 states, the decision to allow concealed carry is made by the individual college or university. Eight states fully allow concealed carry on all public college campuses: Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin."

(For the record, the theorem states that there are no whole number solutions to the equation xn + yn = zn when n is greater than 2.)\n\nWiles says he hopes his work will serve as inspiration for up-and-coming numbers aces \"to take up mathematics and to work on the many challenges of this beautiful and fascinating subject.\" (Prime numbers just got a little weirder.)\n\nThis story originally appeared on Newser."

   "ARTICLE": "Former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who returned to his native Chicago earlier this year after nearly seven years with the Obama administration, said on Thursday that he will join a philanthropic campaign underwritten by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\nDuncan, 51, will join the Emerson Collective as a managing partner, leading a “comprehensive effort” to improve opportunities for young people in Chicago.\n\nThe work will initially focus on young people aged 17 to 24 who are neither working nor in school, many of whom have criminal records and lack high school diplomas, the organization said. Duncan's work will explore “factors in schools, homes and communities that contribute to crime, joblessness and social breakdown.”\n\n“A young person growing up in Chicago ought to be able to chart a clear roadmap toward a bright future,” Duncan said in a statement. “But for too many inner city kids, the path is marred by poverty, violence, broken social networks and schools that can’t keep up with the challenges in tough neighborhoods. The violence is a symptom of hopelessness and our priority is to give young people hope by getting them jobs.”\n\nDuncan said he’s focused on disconnected youth in Chicago because of a recent surge in violence there. The Chicago Tribune last year reported that the city saw 488 homicides.\n\nIn his final speech as U. S. Education Secretary last December, Duncan delivered a blunt, sometimes unsparing address that challenged adults to help restore safety and a basic sense of hope to millions of young people — many of whom, he said, don't expect to make it to adulthood. Speaking from the basement of a church on Chicago's South Side, Duncan directly linked the U.S. high school dropout rate with its youth homicide rate, saying both problems spring from the same \"collective failure as adults\" to nurture and protect children.\n\n\"Dropping out is one level of hopelessness,\" he said. \"And picking up a gun and shooting someone is just that in the extreme.\"\nMoments into his farewell speech, Duncan's voice shook as he recounted one grim statistic: About 16,000 young people had been killed, he said, in his first six years in Washington. The total after seven years was likely \"north of 18,000,\" or an average of seven children killed every day, he said. \"It's a crisis that we have to come together to work on.\"\n\nAsked by an audience member at the event if he had plans to run for public office, Duncan, the former Chicago Schools CEO and a father of two young children, said he had no plans to run for anything — he also noted that he'd never run for elected office. But he said he had returned to his native city to help improve conditions for young people.\n\n\"My wife and I came home to Chicago not because things are easy now, but because things are hard,\" he said.\n\nThe longest-serving member of President Obama's Cabinet — and one of the longest-serving education secretaries ever — Duncan said solving many of these problems would not require great ideas as much as patience and persistence.\n\n\"Honestly, this is not rocket science,\" he said. \"This is not looking for the next cure for cancer. The simple question I'll pose here is: Do we have the will, do we have the courage, do we have the ability to think at scale, not just in pilot programs? Do we have the ability to think comprehensively? Not one piece, but to take the whole thing together? And are we willing to think long-term?\"\n\nDuncan on Thursday said he will also work with Powell Jobs’ XQ SuperSchool Project, an experimental effort that seeks to remake high school for a high-tech, post-factory era. Funded to the tune of $50 million over five years, it will select five or more promising new public high school models later this year and underwrite experimentation — $2 million per year per school.\n\nThe organization on Thursday said nearly 700 design applications have been submitted so far."

   "ARTICLE": "WASHINGTON — Top Senate Republicans have vowed to reject any candidate that President Obama nominates to fill Justice Antonin Scalia’s vacant Supreme Court seat — GOP leaders have even said they'll refuse to meet with the nominee.\n\nBut obstruction likely won't greet Obama's pick to lead the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n\nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., has promised to give Acting U.S. Education Secretary John B. King \"a prompt and fair\" hearing, and on Thursday he got one.\n\nKing told lawmakers that federal officials “have urgent work to do” to help more low-income students complete college, among other challenges.\n\nAt the conclusion of Thursday's hearing, Alexander, himself a former education secretary, announced that the committee would vote on King's appointment within weeks — March 9 — clearing the way for a full Senate vote.\n\nSenate Republicans have stalled many of Obama's nominees in recent months, but Alexander has said he doesn't want to go an entire year without a new education secretary. He has pledged to \"work to have that person immediately confirmed.\"\n\nObama, who named King as acting secretary last October, after former Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he’d step down, had originally planned to forego confirmation hearings. But he changed his mind after Alexander urged the president to bring the nomination to the Senate. Obama said he'd nominate King just two months after Congress approved a sweeping reauthorization of the federal No Child Left Behind law.\n\nActually, Alexander said on Thursday that it was at the signing ceremony for the new law in December where he urged Obama to send a nominee to Capitol Hill.\n\n“I did that because this is such an important year for our nation’s schools,” said Alexander, who served as education secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. \"We need an education secretary who is confirmed and accountable to Congress while we're implementing a law that may govern elementary and secondary education for some time.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Alexander told King that 25 years ago this month, he was “sitting in the same position as you testifying before the same committee at a hearing for my nomination” to Bush’s Cabinet.\n\nKing has served as acting secretary since Arne Duncan stepped down at the end of December.\n\nMike Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a Washington, D.C., education think tank, said Alexander “is giving the country a lesson in what the government looks like when it functions as it’s supposed to. The fact that this is considered unusual is an illustration of just how dysfunctional our government has become.”\n\nHe noted that with King’s positions on charter schools, rigorous teacher evaluations and student testing, King may actually make a few committee Democrats more uncomfortable than Republicans.\n\n“It seems like the Republicans were at least as supportive of John King as the Democrats were,” he said.\n\nThough King’s possible appointment would likely end when a new president takes office early next year, Petrilli said the remaining months of Obama’s presidency are full of important education issues such as the administration’s push to make for-profit colleges more accountable. Obama has also pushed colleges to better tackle the problem of sexual assault, including releasing the names of colleges and universities in 2014 that were facing Title IX investigations for their handling of such cases.\n\nKing on Thursday said the issue continues to be a priority.\n\nDuring the hearing, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa., the top Democrat on the committee, noted that the Obama administration has a little less than a year left in office. “But that is still plenty of time to make progress in several key areas.”\n\nKing, 41, is a former social studies teacher and middle- and high-school school principal. By all indications, he is the first school principal ever to serve in the top education job. He also spent several years as New York State’s education commissioner, the first African-American and first Puerto Rican to fill the role.\n\nIn public appearances since his appointment, King has often recounted his own childhood experiences with inspiring teachers. In his words, they “saved my life.” He did the same during Thursday's hearing.\n\nRising from a tumultuous childhood in Canarsie, a blue-collar Brooklyn neighborhood, King earned a bachelor’s degree in government from Harvard University, a master’s degree and education doctorate from Columbia University's Teachers College and a law degree from Yale. In between degrees, he taught high school social studies in Puerto Rico and Boston and co-founded Roxbury Prep, one of a growing number of “no excuses” charter schools that use strict discipline, longer school days and close attention to data to improve the skills of their mostly minority, low-income students.\n\nKing also helped found Uncommon Schools, a New York-based charter school chain.\n\nThe Senate has been cast into the turmoil of a presidential election season by Scalia's death, with Republicans saying they will not advance anyone Obama nominates and Democrats saying the GOP has been taken over by \"extremists.\"\n\nThe president is still considering possible nominees to replace Scalia, who died on Feb. 13."

   "ARTICLE": "Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who last month nearly became the first governor in the state’s history to be impeached, said Thursday that he would skip the normal selection process for a new state education commissioner. Instead, he said, he would represent the state Department of Education in dealings with legislators.\n\n“I will be the commissioner,” LePage said Thursday during an appearance before a Portland-area business group, local media reported.\n\nVideo of the appearance, posted online by the Bangor Daily News, showed LePage, a Republican, criticizing state Democrats for promising to block the nomination of acting Commissioner William Beardsley.\n\n“They have nothing against him,” LePage said. “It’s not Dr. Beardsley that they’re after. If you’ve heard — you might have heard — they tried to impeach me this year. There’s so much hatred by the leadership of the Democrats in the House that there’s nothing I can do that will solve anything.”\n\nLePage said he pulled Beardsley’s nomination “because he has no chance of surviving.”\n\nHe added, “It’s a sad day when that’s what we have to do.”\n\nLePage said Beardsley will serve out his term as acting commissioner for the state-mandated six-month limit, then remain as deputy commissioner until LePage’s term expires in 2018.\n\n“It broke my heart to have to pull that nomination, but he was going to get defeated,” LePage said. “It was going to go down, 7-6. The Democrats said that they were not going to support it. This way here, I can keep him, he keeps working and when his acting commissioner status leaves, he will be the deputy commissioner and I will be the commissioner. That way there I can keep him.”\n\nIn a statement, Lois Kilby-Chesley, president of the Maine Education Association, said, “The duty of commissioner of education is a full-time job, the deputy commissioner is also a full-time job. To not appoint a commissioner to the Department of Education is a disservice to Maine students who deserve better.”\n\nLater Thursday, LePage told reporters he did not intend to actually serve as the education commissioner, the Bangor Daily News reported. He said he would address legislators if they want to hear about the administration’s education policies, “and if anything needs the signature of a commissioner, the governor will do it.”\n\nA group of Maine House Democrats tried unsuccessfully last month to impeach LePage. Instead, legislators backed a symbolic \"civility\" measure that indirectly criticized him.\n\nLePage, who has been pushing for more money to fight out-of-state drug traffickers, caused a media firestorm on Jan. 6 when he said during a speech, “These are guys with the name Dee Money, Smoothie, Shifty — these types of guys — they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road.”\n\nHe later said the comment was a slip-up, the Portland Press-Herald reported. LePage said he meant to say “Maine women” rather than “white women.”"

   "ARTICLE": "More than one million high school students have used new, free test prep materials to study for the revamped SAT — four times as many as the number who use commercial test prep in the USA each year, The College Board’s president said on Wednesday.\n\nAppearing at the annual South by Southwest Education festival, David Coleman, President and CEO of the College Board, said the free materials, offered online through a partnership with the popular Khan Academy website, have the potential to make the college admissions process fairer and more colorblind .\n\n“Never in my career have I seen a launch of technology at this scale that has broken down the racial divisions that so haunt this nation — never,” he said. “More students, whatever their level of income, are preparing for the SAT with Khan Academy than with all commercial test prep combined — at every level of income.”\n\nU.S. students took the new SAT for the first time last Saturday, two years nearly to the day after Coleman announce the changes at a press conference here.\n\nAmong other changes, the new SAT returns the test's perfect score from its old 2,400-point-scale to 1,600 points and abandons vocabulary questions built around what even Coleman conceded was a \"wall of obscure words.\"\n\nIn its place, he said, The College Board created a test that more accurately tracks what students learn in school, that focuses more tightly on a few key concepts and doesn't force kids to rely on expensive test-prep courses or \"last-minute tricks or cramming\" to do well.\n\nThe changes, the first since 2005, came in the face of several recent challenges, including skepticism from colleges about the test's usefulness and competition from the rival ACT test.\n\nIn 2014, Coleman called the new SAT a \"call to action\" to make the test a better tool to help students get ready for college.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coleman said students had already told researchers that the new test better resembled the work they’re doing in school, and that the once-dreaded vocabulary section now tests for words that would be more useful in their lives.\n\n“It is not enough to make a better test,” he said. “It is not enough to say to students they must take the test. Instead we had to rethink the exam entirely, to first and foremost make it so that it was utterly identical, it was the same work that they were already doing in school, that it was not O.K. to say to kids that they had to study something for the SAT.”\n\nThe 90-year-old test, once referred to as a “scholastic aptitude” test, is now officially described as an “achievement” test, designed to reward not innate intelligence but hard work and persistence, among other traits.\n\nFor many high school students, especially younger ones who consent to have their Khan Academy online accounts synced with their PSAT/NMSQT test results, the test prep materials actually offer test prep keyed to their weaknesses, said Sal Khan, Khan Academy’s founder.\n\n“The message is, ‘You just took the PSAT — that’s a really powerful diagnostic,’” he said. “All that information from the PSAT, what questions you got right, what questions you got wrong, the difficulty level, gets slurped into our system.”\n\nKhan, who for years has offered free online instruction through the website, said typical philanthropic efforts give underserved kids “a cheaper version” of the high-quality facilities and offerings that middle-class kids get. “Why not aspire to create something so good that even the most affluent who has the payment options will want to use it?”\n\nColeman said a lot of traditional paid test prep is actually excellent, but that the high price tag worsens inequality in college admissions. The new test, combined with the free test prep materials, will likely flatten demand for the paid version as more students find out about it. He and Khan noted that the new SAT coincided with a 20% drop in students using paid test prep.\n\n“And we are just getting started,” Coleman said."

   "ARTICLE": "Jeb Bush marked the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday Monday by releasing a plan on what he called the modern-day civil rights challenge of education.\n\n\"Dr. King's vision for America was based on equality of opportunity,\" Bush said in a video announcing the plan. \"Without a quality education there is no equality of opportunity. It is the civil rights issue of our time.\"\n\nIn the video and a post for the website Medium, Bush said his plan is based on school choice (including charter schools), accountability for student achievement, an emphasis on early childhood education, and moving authority from the federal government to local officials, teachers, and parents.\n\nBush wrote in his Medium post that improving schools \"doesn’t require additional money or programs designed by Washington,\" and \"that’s why my plan is budget neutral and returns power to states, local school districts and parents.\"\n\nThe former Florida governor calls for converting federal tax-free college savings accounts to overall \"Education Savings Accounts\" that parents could use to finance any level of schooling, including charter schools pre-K programs. Bush also calls for consolidating a variety of federal assistance programs into funds that states can use to finance scholarships for low-income students.\n\nBush, who has dropped in Republican polls behind Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and other rivals, released his education plan two weeks before the Iowa caucuses open the GOP nomination process.\n\nThe education plan includes a revival of required reporting on student achievement, saying that \"transparency yields better results.\"\n\nAs for rising college costs, Bush called for a restructuring of how loans are made.\n\n\"Instead of the current burdensome federal loan system, we will give all high school graduates access to a $50,000 line of credit through their Educative Savings Account (ESA) to pay for college and career training,\" Bush wrote. \"For every $10,000 spent, students would repay 1% of their income for 25 years.\"\n\nSome of Bush's ideas stem from his years as Florida's governor from 1999 to 2007. Critics said his emphasis on school choice promoted private education at the expenses of public schools, shortchanging poor students in particular.\n\nIn his Medium post, Bush said poor students are being hurt by the current system.\n\n\"The American Dream — the idea that anything is possible through hard work — is threatened by an education system failing to prepare the next generation of children for success,\" he said."

   "ARTICLE": "On the last day of Black History Month, The Atlantic published an article entitled Will the Push for Coding Lead to \"Technical Ghettos\"?\n\nThe article uses an inflammatory and racially charged phrase, “technical ghettos,” to voice concern from some quarters that programs such as Kimberly Bryant's Black Girls Code are not teaching young people of color the kind of computational thinking needed to achieve success in the tech workforce. The contention: That these programs are myopically focused on teaching kids to code.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. I am one of those educators who provides opportunities for our kids through Qeyno Labs, an inclusive innovation company that three years ago launched Hackathon Academy as a \"pop-up school.\"\n\nWe do much more than teach kids to code, and that is what makes our programs widely popular among low-opportunity youth and their communities. In our coding programs, we teach young people to be hackers, and the first thing we teach them to hack is their own isolation, because poverty is not desperation or deprivation, poverty is isolation.\n\nYoung people taking part in a Black Girls Code workshop, a Qeyno hackathon or in a boot camp at The Hidden Genius Project build apps that address the challenges in their communities such as sex trafficking, police brutality and teen depression. We provide culturally-relevant wrap-around education and workforce development that empowers and prepares our kids to succeed not just as engineers in the tech workforce, but as entrepreneurs and artists. And the experts cited in this article would know this had they ever visited our classrooms, hackathons or boot camps.\n\nTo suggest that this work to level the playing field in computer science is creating “technical ghettos” is to cast a negative light on enterprising young people of color and on those of us who are lifting systemic barriers to their paths forward as innovators.\n\nWhy do we do this work? Because computer science education in our country has failed our kids. I am not waiting for Superman to teach our kids what their peers in Silicon Valley learn in their private, elite schools.\n\nMainstream education is afraid  that our young people won’t learn computational thinking or critical thinking unless that happens in their schools, during their hours, and under their pedagogical control. They are afraid of a mass exodus (as seen in the rise  of homeschooling among families of color) away from an education industry too big to fail, but that fails our children, their families, and their communities in big ways.\n\nThe bottom line is this, if mainstream education was doing its job, we would not have ours.\n\nKalimah Priforce is Headmaster CEO of Qeyno Labs, an inclusive innovation company. He is a White house Champion of Change and an Echoing Green Fellow based in Oakland."

   "ARTICLE": "Apple is no longer the undisputed head of the K-12 class.\n\nFor the first time, Chromebook sales surpassed 51% in the K-12 market nationwide in the third quarter, according to a recent report by market researcher Futuresource Consulting. The surge reflects a fundamental shift in how American schools are buying tech in bulk and assessing students online, placing an emphasis on low-cost, easy-to-manage machines.\n\n“It's a tidal wave: Chrome is the clear U.S. market leader now,” says Mike Fisher, associate director of education technology at Futuresource. He says districts are drawn to the Chromebook’s Web-based operating system, ease of use, IT manageability and $200 to $300 price range.\n\nChromebooks — laptops running Google's Chrome OS as their operating systems — made significant strides, year over year. Chromebooks' market share jumped to 51% from 40%. Apple products, mostly iPads but also laptops and Mac desktops, declined to 24% from 32%. Windows-based machines remained steady at 23%.\n\nAnd Chrome's growth is accelerating, says Rajen Sheth, director of product management, Chrome and Android, for work and education, at Google. \"We were at 1% to 2% (in 2012),\" Sheth says. He was at the Consumer Electronics Show last week, where OEMs were launching new Chromebooks, many of which will find their way into schools. \"This has been trending for three years.\"\n\nMicrosoft, through national contracts and Windows-based machines, remains on top for the K-12 market worldwide, with a 47% share. Chromebooks follows at 19% and Apple at 13%, Futuresource says.\n\nWinning students at an early age is considered crucial for tech companies  in the approximately $15 billion K-12 market in the U.S.\n\nApple, through its dominance of the education market during the Steve Jobs years, helped establish its strong brand and shaped the computing habits of millions of young Americans.\n\nAPPLE UPDATES IOS\n\nThe trend away from Apple products hasn't gone unnoticed by the Cupertino, Calif., company now run by Tim Cook. Monday, it released education updates to its mobile operating system, version iOS 9.3 — namely, a simplified login and the ability to more easily share and manage iPads in schools securely — in hopes of wresting back market share. It also has shaved iPad prices.\n\nApple is still big in education. There are about 170,000 education apps on the App Store, and the company maintains a large installed base of iPads and MacBooks in schools. It has sold 15 million iPads into educational institutions worldwide.\n\nBut its position has changed. While Apple's dominance in K-12 has played an essential role in its success, \"it no longer is a leader but a player\" in the space, says Brian Blau, lead Apple analyst at market researcher Gartner.\n\nThe recent movement toward lower-priced, manageable devices reflects a sea change in the education market, Fisher says. \"Districts need more volume (in technology equipment), and they need to deploy for the online assessment of students,\" he says. \"Chromebooks offer the answer for now.\"\n\nAt many school districts nationwide, computer use increasingly is being segmented between iPads and tablets for younger students and Chromebooks and notebooks for middle grades and up, Fisher says.\n\n'COST AND BENEFIT'\n\nIts inexpensive price tag and free apps made Chromebooks an easy choice for Matt Smith, director of technology at Central School District 301 in Burlington, Ill., where 3,800 K-12 students primarily use Chromebook. \"Cost and benefit makes it the best product,\" says Smith, who wanted each student to have access to a computing device.\n\nAt Aurora City Schools in Ohio, most of the 3,000 K-12 students use Chromebooks, school superintendent Pat Ciccantelli says.\n\n\"It is a powerful tool for $150 that opens up the world to kids,\" says Dayna Steele, CEO of yourdailysuccesstip.com, an advice website. Over the past two years, she has donated 135 Chromebooks to schools in Houston, Atlanta and Miami.\n\nChromebooks may soon find more competition in the low-price range.\n\nMicrosoft is partnering with software firm Lightspeed to better manage a range of devices at schools, and it is helping bring to market new devices that are likely to compete head-on with Google in the sub-$300 range.\n\n\"We recognize that schools have different uses, at a variety of price points, for the learning of subjects,\" says Anthony Salcito, vice president of worldwide education for Microsoft.\n\nCarl Hooker, director of innovation and digital learning at Eanes Independent School District in Austin, where 8,000 K-12 students are enrolled, says he’s likely to stick with iPads after four years and the district is considering options other than Chromebooks. “We looked at Chromebooks but felt it was limited in innovation and creativity,” he says.\n\nApple can still rely on its education bona fides, but given its rivals' growth, likely not for long."

   "ARTICLE": "Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of the story below mischaracterized the number of arrests before the Donald Trump rally in Fountain Hills, Ariz.\n\nFOUNTAIN HILLS, Ariz. — Violence once again marred a Donald Trump campaign event Saturday as the Republican front-runner rallied thousands of supporters at two stops ahead of Arizona's presidential primary.\n\nVideo from an event in Tucson shows protester Bryan Sanders getting escorted out of the building by security when he is punched in the head and then kicked while on the ground.\n\nSanders, who had an anti-Trump poster,  told  NBC News he was shocked when a man in the stands grabbed his sign and ripped it out of his hands.\n\n\"I stumble back, sucker punch ... and then you saw all hell break loose,\" Sanders said. \"He's stomping me.\"\n\nSanders said he feared for his life during the attack. \"What was going through my mind was: Put your arms over your head, because this political movement has gotten to the point where you may get beat to death inside of a rally,\" he said.\n\nTony Pettway, 32, was charged with assault with an injury, a misdemeanor, and released.\n\nVideos have circulated of another incident at the rally involving Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The videos show him reaching for a protester's collar as a security guard grabs the protester from behind. Trump briefly addressed the issue of protesters at his events, telling the crowd \"they aren't really protesters, they are agitators.\"\n\nIn an email to CBS, a Trump spokeswoman said, \"Corey Lewandowski was speaking with a protester at today's rally in Tucson, Arizona when the individual he was speaking with was pulled from behind by the man to Lewandowski's left. The video clearly shows the protester reacting to the man who pulled him, not to Mr. Lewandowski. Mr. Trump does not condone violence at his rallies, which are private events paid for by the campaign.\"\n\nProtesters block access to Phoenix-area rally\n\nEarlier Saturday, a massive crowd waited for hours in warm sunshine to hear Trump speak in this Phoenix suburb. Access to the rally was chaotic after protesters a few miles away succeeded in closing the main route into Fountain Hills for about an hour.\n\n\"Donald Trump, shut it down. Phoenix is a people's town,\" and \"Get this clown out of our town,\" the demonstrators chanted. Many protesters carried signs saying \"Stand against racism.\"\n\nThree protesters were arrested Saturday prior to the start of the rally. The protesters had chained themselves to cars blocking the road leading to Fountain Hills. Sheriff’s deputies used bolt cutters to cut the chains from the three protesters who locked themselves to the doors of their vehicles. The two women and one man were taken away in plastic handcuffs.\n\nTrump, wearing a blue jacket and red \"Make America Great Again\" golf hat, arrived about 50 minutes after the scheduled 11 a.m. start time.\n\n\"Tuesday is so important,\" he said. \"We have a movement going on.\"\n\n\"Go out on Tuesday and vote. I will never let you down,\" he said, referring to his supporters as a \"loud, noisy majority.\"\n\nSome in the crowd said Trump's blunt, sometimes offensive, talk is a big part of his appeal.\n\n\"I like that he's blunt, that there's no political correctness with him, that he says what he means,\" said Tracy Walter, 45, a receptionist from Fountain Hills. She said she likes Trump's political-outsider status and she wanted to be a part of this \"once-in-a-lifetime event.\"\n\n\"If he hurts somebody's feelings, well, you can't be like that every day. And I like his views on immigration,\" she said.\n\nDede Nay, a retired teacher, traveled to Fountain Hills from Pinetop to hear Trump.\n\n\"There's a lot of bad things that are going on in the government – corruption. And I pray he makes it to the end, but if he doesn't I think the one good thing that he has done is expose the corruption that's not only rampant in the Democratic Party, but it's also in the Republican Party,\" she said. \"We keep electing ... Republicans in, and nothing's been done. They have betrayed us.\"\n\nTrump draws crowd, protests\n\nThousands of miles away in New York City, hundreds of protesters gathered near Trump Tower in Columbus Circle on Saturday to march toward the Fifth Avenue skyscraper the billionaire businessman owns and lives in, local media reported. MSNBC reported three demonstrators were arrested as the crowd tried to push into the streets of the bustling city.\n\nOn Friday night, demonstrators clashed with police and supporters outside a Trump rally in Salt Lake City. Last week, the Republican front-runner canceled a rally over security concerns after protesters and supporters clashed at the University of Illinois at Chicago ahead of the planned event.\n\nDelegates at stake\n\nTrump has maintained a comfortable lead in the Arizona polls over Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the second-running Republican in the race, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Up for grabs on the Republican side are 58 Republican National Convention delegates. The winner will sweep all of the delegates.\n\nHowever, Cruz campaigned in Arizona for the first time Friday, telling the crowd at a Phoenix rally that while Trump may be leading in Arizona's early voting, his campaign is surging. Cruz said he has gained the support of former backers of Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who exited the GOP race Tuesday. He said turnout will be key to determine the winner of the Arizona GOP primary, or presidential preference election as it is officially known."

   "ARTICLE": "PHOENIX — Ted Cruz, the high-octane conservative U.S. senator from Texas, made the case Friday night in Phoenix that he provides the only viable alternative to GOP front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nDuring a nationally televised appearance before a raucous, capacity crowd at Arizona Christian University, Cruz criticized Ohio Gov. John Kasich for staying in the race for the Republican presidential nomination and continuing to split the anti-Trump vote. Kasich has won just one state this primary season: his home state.\n\nCruz said that while Trump has done well in early Arizona voting, his campaign is surging in the state now. He also suggested that he is picking up support from former backers of Marco Rubio, the U.S. senator from Florida who exited the race on Tuesday after losing his home state to Trump.\n\n\"There's no good reason (for Kasich to stay in the race),\" Cruz said during a question-and-answer session with conservative TV and radio commentator Sean Hannity that was carried live on the Fox News Channel. \"He is essentially the spoiler. A vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump.\"\n\nCruz's dig at Kasich, made just a few days before Tuesday's winner-take-all Arizona presidential preference election, prompted a Twitter response from John Weaver, the Kasich campaign's chief strategist.\n\n\"Cruz is a spoiler. A vote for either Cruz or Trump is a vote for Hillary,\" Weaver tweeted.\n\nCruz, who like Trump is an opponent of what he characterizes as \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants, headlined the gathering of his supporters after touring the Arizona-Mexico border earlier in the day.\n\nAt the Phoenix rally, he recounted what he saw.\n\n\"The border fence, the little fence there is there, is so dilapidated, is so ineffectual,\" Cruz said, adding that his 5-year-old daughter could easily climb it.\n\nThe rally crowd was solidly conservative, even booing the mention of U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. They wildly cheered when Cruz outlined his tough-on-illegal-immigration proposals.\n\n\"You know that there's a new, politically correct term for illegal aliens: It's called undocumented Democrats,\" Cruz quipped at one point.\n\nCruz insisted that, unlike President Obama, he would have the political will to finally secure the border.\n\n\"You enforce the laws and what the laws provide is that if you're here illegally, you're deported,\" he said to applause.\n\nYesenia Crothers, of Globe, attended the rally with her husband, Jason. He said he’s a solid Cruz vote. She’s still deciding.\n\n“I’ve decided who I’m not voting for,” she said, laughing. “I want to hear what Ted Cruz has to say, find out more about his views and his character.\"\n\nJason Crothers said he believes Cruz will uphold the Constitution and supports his strong family values. “His character is a big part of it, too,” he said.\n\nRaquel Hamstra, 19, and Nate Perez, 19, students at Arizona Christian, wore matching hand-painted red shirts. Perez’s read “Dump Trump” and Hamstra’s “Choose Cruz.\"\n\n“I was supporting (Marco) Rubio, but when he dropped out, I moved to Cruz. He has a good plan for America,” Hamstra said. “He’s a very good Christian guy. He supports a strong military and smaller government and is pro-life.”\n\nBob and Tori Morley of Gilbert said they came to the rally to show their support.\n\n“He’s someone who stands on his principles,” Bob Morley said, adding that he also supports Cruz’s adherence to the Constitution. He said he feels this election is particularly important as the next president will likely pick the next U.S. Supreme Court justice.\n\nCruz has been running second to Trump, the celebrity billionaire, in Arizona, polls show, just as he is nationally. Arizona's election is on the same day as Utah's GOP caucuses, where Cruz is expected to prevail."

   "ARTICLE": "WASHINGTON — Florida may prove crucial to Donald Trump’s presidential hopes if the Republican nomination race goes to a contested convention.\n\nUnder the state's GOP rules, all of the 99 delegates Trump received when he won Florida's March 15 primary must vote for him through the first three nominating ballots at a contested convention.\n\nThat makes Florida unique.\n\nThirty-one states and territories require Republican delegates to support the winner of a given primary or caucus only for the first ballot, according to the Republican National Committee. Seven require delegates to back the primary or caucus winner for the first two ballots. The remaining 19 don’t bind their delegates at all or let them make their own choice once the candidate they were tied to either withdraws from the race or releases them to vote for someone else.\n\nThat means Florida, the most important swing state in the November election, also could play a key role buttressing Trump at the July convention in Cleveland if he doesn't secure the necessary 1,237 delegates before then, which seems increasingly likely.\n\nIt also means Florida's 99 delegates initially will play no significant role at what could be the most tumultuous party convention in decades.\n\n\"We’re going to be standing up there in Cleveland like a bunch of nobodies,” said Bill Folchi, chairman of the Charlotte County Republican Party, who was elected last week as a delegate to the convention. “They’ll walk right past us.”\n\nGOP officials in each of the state's 27 congressional districts will pick three delegates and three alternates to send to the convention. County party officials will elect the delegates between March 23 and May 10.\n\nOn May 14, Florida's Republican executive committee also will choose 15 at-large delegates. Three additional slots automatically will go to state party chairwoman Blaise Ingoglia, National Committeeman Peter Feaman and National Committeewoman Sharon Day,\n\nAny Floridian who's a registered Republican voter can apply to be a delegate, though those chosen tend to have a demonstrated record of party involvement. So far, more than 500 have done so “and the applications continue to pour in,” said Wadi Gaitan, spokesman for the state Republican Party.\n\nTrump won the state decisively last month, winning 46% of the vote and crushing home state senator Marco Rubio who promptly quit the presidential race.\n\nLocal GOP officials seem divided about what delegates should do if the convention reaches a fourth ballot.\n\nPalm Beach County Republican Chairman Michael Barnett, a Trump supporter, told the Palm Beach Post he believes Florida's delegates should stick with the billionaire businessman.\n\n“Should it go beyond three ballots, I personally will support the winner of the Florida primary and I personally think that’s what delegates should do — respect the will of the voters,” Barnett said.\n\nBut Folchi of Punta Gorda said his vote won’t be a rubber stamp, especially if he concludes Trump wouldn't be the most electable candidate in November.\n\n“Charlotte County voted for Trump, so I’d be inclined to support the county. The state voted for Trump so I’d be inclined to support the state,” he said. “But 100% of the voters didn’t vote for Trump, so there’s clearly some wiggle room and room for judgment. That’s why they call it an election.”\n\nRep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., agrees delegates shouldn’t automatically back Trump when they’re free to pick someone else.\n\n“If Trump is getting to a fourth ballot, he’s in trouble,” said Rooney, who co-chaired Rubio’s campaign in Florida. “If he’s not locking it up by the fourth ballot, that’s a hard argument for any candidate to make that he’s still owed those votes.”"

Trump's opponents said the U.S. should stand with Israel, not declare neutrality.\n\n\"I think making a deal would be in Israel's interests,'' Trump told ABC's This Week. \"I'll tell you what, I don't know one Jewish person that doesn't want to have a deal, a good deal, a proper deal, but a really good deal,'' the candidate said.\n\nTrump, however, declined to define what such a deal would include or how he intended to address the matter in his Monday speech.\n\n\"Well, I'll define that tomorrow,\" Trump told ABC. \"I'm not going to define it now.\"\n\nNot all conference attendees are so anxious to hear Trump's explanation and some are planning a demonstration, though different from those that have followed the candidate's rallies and appearances.\n\nRabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism with represents about 900 congregations, said he and other Jewish leaders are planning on skipping the speech to lead a study on \"Jewish values.''\n\n\"The values of our reform Jewish movement include equality, diversity, justice, humility, and civility,'' Jacobs said. \"Thus far, Mr. Trump has conducted his campaign as if those are not his values.”\n\nRabbi Jonah Pesner, senior vice president of the URJ, said Trump's \"hateful rhetoric and bigoted comments'' have set a disturbing tone in the campaign.\n\n\"Such behavior is unacceptable in American society,'' Pesner said.\n\nTrump's arrival in D.C. comes after yet another volatile weekend on the campaign trail where violence continued to shadow rallies and other appearances. He attributed the persistent troubles to paid \"agitators\" bent on derailing his presidential bid.\n\nThough he acknowledged that the beating of demonstrator at a weekend Arizona rally was “tough to watch,\" Trump suggested Sunday that he was more concerned that his rallies and speeches were being targeted for disruption.\n\n“I wouldn't use the word upset,\" Trump said on ABC, referring to the Arizona clash in which a man draped in an American flag was repeatedly punched and kicked. “I think it's very unfair that these really, in many cases, professional, in many cases, sick, protesters can put cars in a road blocking thousands of great Americans from coming to a speech and nobody says anything about that.\"\n\nResponding to earlier suggestions that his supporters could riot if he was denied the nomination at a possible brokered Republican convention later this summer, Trump said he didn’t want “problems’’ but described his supporters as formidable.\n\n“Look, these people are fervent,\" he said. “They are really -- they want to see positive things happen for our country…I don't want to see riots. I don't want to see problems. But, you know…I've gotten more than two million votes more than anybody else.\"\n\nOn the business side, Trump has invited the press to join him Monday for a tour of the Old Post Office, the historic building on Pennsylvania Ave. between the U.S. Capitol and the White House that Trump is converting into a hotel."

   "ARTICLE": "Nearly a generation has gone by since a presidential candidate stepped foot on Navajo Nation lands.\n\nThe last was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 1999, the home-state hopeful.\n\nSo when Bernie Sanders, the long-shot Democratic contender from Vermont, took the stage Thursday at the tribe’s finest casino, Native voters like 18-year-old Sage Jon Deangelis Romero were ecstatic.\n\n“It makes me proud. It makes me feel represented. It makes me feel like I belong,” said the Flagstaff resident, who counts Navajo, Hopi and Hispanics among his ancestors. “ ... He’s trying to get our vote because he feels that we’re also important. Not just blowing past us like all the other candidates.”\n\nSporting a gray beanie and bursting with passion, Deangelis Romero is one of the legions of Millennial voters who have flocked to Sanders as he makes bold promises such as tuition-free college.\n\nBut Deangelis Romero, who was part of the racially mixed crowd that included tribal members in traditional turquoise jewelry, was also helping the Sanders campaign send a signal.\n\nAs the candidate has barnstormed across Arizona ahead of the state's presidential primary on Tuesday, Sanders is trying to make a case that Democratic rival Hillary Clinton doesn't have a lock on minority voters.\n\nHe has lost the Black and Hispanic vote badly to Clinton in past primaries. And she won all five states in Tuesday's contests, leaving him far behind her in the delegate count.\n\nBut if Sanders can siphon off her support starting with Arizona's primary, he might be able to reverse that trend.\n\nFocusing on issues that affect Latinos and Native Americans\n\nAs a sign of his efforts in Arizona, Sanders has opened his rallies with Hispanic, undocumented and Native American speakers and touched on issues important to many minorities, such as stopping deportations.\n\nSanders’ most explicit appeal to Arizona’s tribal voters came Thursday, when nearly a quarter of his speech was dedicated to Native issues.\n\n“All too often Native Americans have not been heard on issues that impact their communities. They have been told what to do. They have not been involved in the process,” he said. “The United States government has a duty of ensuring equal opportunity and justice to all of its citizens, including our First Americans.”\n\nHe called for protecting Native languages, cracking down on sexual violence by non-Natives against tribal women, blocking a copper mine planned for land used by tribes near Superior and renaming Washington, D.C.'s professional football team.\n\nHe's had some success. In Iowa, he visited the Meskwaki Nation – in contrast with Clinton, who met with its leaders off the reservation – and won that vote overwhelmingly.\n\nBut Sanders' one night of campaigning on the reservation doesn't match rival Hillary Clinton's decades-long tribal relationships, her campaign said. Clinton plans to meet with tribal leaders Monday in Phoenix, where she will hold a rally at Carl Hayden Community High School.\n\nClinton calling on existing relationship with tribes\n\nHillary Clinton first visited the Navajo Nation in 1992 on behalf of her husband Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign, taking their daughter Chelsea in the annual Navajo Nation Fair parade, a rite of passage for politicians across Arizona.\n\nClinton’s guide was then-Navajo President Peterson Zah. The two met in the 1970s when she was chair of Legal Services Corporation, a non-profit that provides legal help to the poor, including tribal members.\n\nAs president, Bill Clinton also visited the reservation. And the Clintons have stood up for Native issues, Zah said. Republican candidates, who have had a rocky relationship with the tribes, receive such minimal support from tribal voters they don’t bother visiting, Zah said.\n\n“[The Clintons] both have the experience of coming to the Navajo Nation. They know the Navajo people,” he told The Arizona Republic. “When she was First Lady and then as a (U.S.) senator she was always trying to help the Native people.”\n\nZah, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2008 over Barack Obama, recorded a radio ad in the Navajo language in favor of Clinton that will begin airing soon in northern Arizona.\n\n“She knows us and the way we live,” he says in it. “I trust her.”\n\nTrust is a key issue\n\nTrust is a major theme of the 2016 election, and for some Native voters, it resonates even more strongly.\n\nAfter generations of broken treaties and failed promises from the federal government, tribal voters are wary of being let down again, voters and the campaigns say.\n\n“It’s a constant thing to feel passed over, to feel ignored,” Deangelis Romero said. “We were treated as foreigners in our own country, in a land that our ancestors died to protect. We weren’t even considered citizens except in the past 100 years.”\n\nSanders’ unwavering approach to his ideology shows he’ll stick to his promises, the young voter said.\n\nAnd Sanders is promising that tribes will have a guaranteed representative in every federal agency and more autonomy, said his Native American strategist Nicole Willis.\n\n“His message to tribal nations is empowering (them),\" Willis said. \"It’s about the government knowing when to take a step back and stop meddling in tribal government and when the federal government needs to step up in areas where it has failed to meet its obligations.”\n\nCampaign manager Jeff Weaver put it bluntly: “He would not forget the Native American people.”\n\nClinton’s campaign says she has matched Sanders’ promises and more. She has posted two pages of policies on her campaign website.\n\n“Indian country is right to be doubtful of politicians making promises,” said Clinton tribal adviser Charlie Galbraith, an Arizona Navajo who worked on Indian affairs for Obama in the White House. But “she has built a long relationship with the community. And not over the course of one election, but over the course of her career. It is a relationship that is deep and long-lasting and will continue well into her presidency.”\n\n'I'm here to speak up for the coal miners'\n\nBut challenges remain for both candidates in wooing the Native vote.\n\nFor Sanders, Arizona’s closed presidential primary means many young people who are registered independents, including tribal members, won't be able to vote for him on Tuesday. Deangelis Romero is among them.\n\nSanders also failed to mention in his speech on the reservation a key issue for people in the area –  a toxic spill into the Animas River that has dealt a blow to Navajo farmland.\n\nAnd both Sanders and Clinton are in a bind with some Native voters for supporting environmental regulations that could put parts of coal-fired power plants, including the Navajo Generating Station, and the mines on the reservation that fuel them, out of business. Hundreds of Native workers could be laid off.\n\nClinton drew ire from leaders in coal country recently for saying, “we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”\n\nThough she also said the federal government should invest in renewable energies and could not “forget those people,” the damage was done with many voters in places like Kentucky, whose economies rely heavily on coal. Those sentiments were echoed by at least one Arizona Navajo voter.\n\nBenjamin Blackhorse, 60, wearing a camouflage hunting cap and windbreaker at the Sanders rally, was offended by the comments. They were enough to turn him off of Clinton, but he wasn’t sure of Sanders.\n\n“My job is on the line,” said Blackhorse, who works at the Kayenta coal mine. “I don’t like what Hillary said. ... I’m here to speak up for the coal miners.”\n\nBlackhorse, who took a day off to come to the event, said he wanted to ask what Sanders would do.\n\n“I heard he’s against fossil fuels,” Blackhorse said. “Why can’t the federal government step up and do what they did with the auto companies (and bail out coal interests)?”\n\nBlackhorse likely left disappointed.\n\nAfter pledging to reduce income inequality for tribal members and raise the minimum wage, Sanders struck a clear blow against Blackhorse’s livelihood: “As a nation we have got to break our dependence on fossil fuels.”"

   "ARTICLE": "As both Democrats and Republicans turn their attention to the critical primary in New York in two weeks, it is worth remembering that the state is defined both by the Big Apple (New York City) and big apple — a vast agricultural economy that is second in the nation in apple production.\n\nThe extraordinary diversity of the state offers fertile ground for all the remaining candidates to try to harvest delegates. Here's a look at where each candidate may thrive:\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nClinton was the U.S. senator from New York and her campaign is headquartered here. The city is Clinton's base, she has deep ties on Wall Street, the Clinton Foundation had an office in Harlem until 2011, and her presidential campaign is headquartered in Brooklyn. She has generally beaten Sanders handily among non-white primary voters, which describes large swaths of the population of not only New York City but also Buffalo, Rochester and other large population centers in the state.\n\nBut when she first ran for Senate in 2000, she began with an upstate listening tour and committed herself to paying attention to the needs of constituents outside the city's five boroughs. She is heavily favored in the state in part because no other candidate can match her network of connections and old loyalties there.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nClinton's home-state advantage does not mean there is no room for Sanders in New York. Sanders has done very well in college towns around the country, and New York has several key ones, including Syracuse and \"the people's republic of Ithaca,\" home to both Ithaca College and Cornell University.\n\nNew York City also offers reason for optimism in the Sanders camp.  For starters, he would be the nation's first Jewish president, and the city has a large Jewish population who may find that compelling. In addition, young hipsters in Greenwich Village and Chelsea and old lefties who have become rich old lefties on the Upper West Side may be feeling the Bern. Jeff Smith, a professor at The New School, suggested that Central Park offers a kind of divide: Sanders may do well on the west side, Clinton may do better on the east.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTrump is a New Yorker in ways even Hillary Clinton can't match, which is a huge advantage, but could also be a disadvantage in some cases. They know him well, and local Republicans are even more familiar than most with his long history of over-the-top public persona.\n\nTrump seems to be the classic new York City personality — perhaps more specifically the classic Yankee Stadium personality — but he has also proven popular in the state's northern regions. The first member of Congress to endorse Trump was GOP Rep. Chris Collins, who represents the suburbs around Buffalo. Republican political consultant Gerry O'Brien also notes this is the home turf of Carl Paladino, a Tea Party-backed businessman who upset the establishment Republican candidate in the 2010 gubernatorial primary but then lost in a landslide to Democrat Andrew Cuomo.\n\nTrump leads every new York poll by more than 20 points, but those margins may shrink as his opponents turn their fire on him on his home turf.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nCruz has two advantages working in his favor heading into New York. One is the momentum (and the fundraising boost it provides) from his victory in Tuesday's Republican primary in Wisconsin. The other is a committed Stop Trump movement that proved in the Badger State that it would mobilize every possible resource to block Trump.\n\nThe problem for Cruz is that he is not a good ideological match for the state. Religious conservatives have been a solid base for Cruz, but \"New York has one of the smallest percentages of born-again Christians,\" Smith said. \"Cruz's only play is going to be to figure out a way to really find every single evangelical voter in New York get them out,\" and then locate conservative clusters he can sway in some of the suburban areas. Cruz had an event in the Bronx on Wednesday, a congressional district with a tiny fraction of Republican voters but three GOP delegates available.\n\nCruz has also made his path in the state harder by disparaging \"New York values\" on the campaign trail. That's not helpful in New York City, but it could resonate upstate where there is deep scorn for the city. Cruz could do well among conservative Republicans in minority areas — black ministers, for example — which would be particularity important in areas with few Republican voters.\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nO'Brien notes that scoring 20% of the vote in a congressional district is enough to qualify for a delegate in the state, which means Kasich \"can do a lot of damage by cherry-picking\" in places like New York City's most Democratic strongholds. There may be only a few thousand Republican voters in some of those districts, and a well-organized targeting campaign could turn out enough of them to pick up a delegate or two.\n\nOur colleague Chrissie Thompson of The Cincinnati Enquirer — who has been following Kasich everywhere — notes that northeast New York, which borders Vermont, could also provide an opportunity for Kasich. \"The Ohio governor lost Vermont to Trump by only 2 percentage points, and New Yorkers living near the border saw the pro-Kasich advertising that hit Vermont ahead of its March 1 primary,\" she pointed out.\n\nJerry Skurnik, a partner in political data firm Prime New York, said Kasich \"has the easiest time finding his voters\" who are the traditional moderate \"Rockefeller Republicans\" who had their root in the Empire State. The problem for Kasich, Skurnik said, is \"over the last few years there have been less and less of these voters voting in the Republican primary."

   "ARTICLE": "Ten years ago, Donald Trump had a pretty open mind about gay marriage.\n\n“If two people dig each other, they dig each other,” he wrote about the marriage of Elton John and longtime partner David Furnish. “I’m very happy for them.”\n\nThe December 2005 comment was posted on the “Trump Blog” that he maintained on the Trump University website, a kind of journal of Trump’s thoughts on everything from why he chose various contestants for Celebrity Apprentice to why women struggle in the workplace:\n\n“I think women have a tough situation in the workplace because of the sexual undertones,\" Trump wrote in October 2005. \"The business environment is so cutthroat that men and women learn to use whatever they can to get ahead, including their sexuality. Yet, when women do this, the perception of them changes. That's why women have to work harder to overcome obstacles.”\n\nThe blog is no longer live on the Internet, some of of blog posts are still viewable through the Internet Archive, a non-profit site that collects website pages.\n\n\"Mr. Trump is not a politician. He has been very clear that his views, like Ronald Reagan’s, have evolved over the years,\" said spokeswoman Hope Hicks.\n\nSome of the opinions Trump expressed on the blog run counter to Republican orthodoxy and to views he now espouses on the campaign trail.\n\nFor instance, on gay marriage, in June 2015 he told CNN, “I’m for traditional marriage.”\n\nIn February 2009, he praised President Obama’s efforts to cap the bonuses of Wall Street executives from companies that were being bailed out by the government, in a post titled “Obama is Absolutely Right.”\n\n“The concept of bailouts is a two-edged sword. If they didn’t do the bailout, we would be in depression No. 2, and maybe it would be just as big as depression No. 1, so they really had to do something. We don’t really know if it’s going to work for quite some time. If it’s really wrong — and it could be wrong — we’re going to really have a mess in two years.\"\n\n\"We are in a situation that is trial and error. We’ve never dealt with this before. But I think Obama is doing the right thing and all of us must remain alert to what is happening.\"\n\nIn another post the same month, discussing his appearance on Neal Cavuto’s television show, Trump seemed to break from the broad Republican opposition to President Obama’s $800 billion stimulus package than most Republicans at the time.\n\n“Neal asked me about Obama’s stimulus plan, and I said that something had to be done, but that there are no guarantees. We are in unmapped territory these days. We haven’t encountered this kind of situation before, and it is complex. We can only hope for the best.”\n\nIn a 2005 post, Trump defended \"outsourcing,\" the practice of companies moving production overseas that he has railed against as a presidential candidate.\n\nIn an August 2005 post titled \"Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run,\" Trump wrote:\n\n\"We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobs — how sending work outside of our companies is contributing to the demise of American businesses. But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.\"\n\nTrump noted a study \"that showed how global outsourcing actually creates more jobs and increases wages, at least for IT workers\":\n\n\"The study found that outsourcing helped companies be more competitive and more productive. That means they make more money, which means they funnel more into the economy, thereby, creating more jobs.\"\n\n\"I know that doesn't make it any easier for people whose jobs have been outsourced overseas, but if a company's only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it's a necessary step. The other option might be to close its doors for good.\"\n\nIn two blog posts at the end of 2008, he praised both President-elect Obama and Hillary Clinton. Recounting his appearance on a New York radio program, Trump wrote that he had said:\n\n\"Hillary is smart, tough and a very nice person, and so is her husband. Bill Clinton was a great President. They are fine people. Hillary was roughed up by the media, and it was a tough campaign for her, but she’s a great trouper. Her history is far from being over.\"\n\nTrump also said he had high hopes for Obama's presidency:\n\n \"Barack will need to be a great president, because we’re in serious trouble as a country. It hasn’t been this way since 1929. So he doesn’t have much choice — he will simply have to be great, which he has a very good chance of being. I saw him speak in Berlin, and what he has done is amazing. The fact that he accomplished what he has in one year is truly phenomenal.\"\n\n\"After 9/11, this country had a lot of compassion from countries around the world. Within a short amount of time, we were hated. How did that happen? We had no dialog with other countries because they just plain hated us. I think we know who is responsible for that. What’s different today is that we have a new chance, a new beginning. The world is excited about Barack Obama and the new United States. Let’s keep it that way!\"\n\nThe Trump Blog also included posts from other authors, some of which also seem far from Trump's current views. In one 2010 post, real estate agent Tina Merritt explained how undocumented immigrants could buy homes in the U.S. \"It is not illegal to own real estate in the U.S. even if one is in the country illegally,\" she wrote. \"If getting a mortgage is not an option, one can always pay cash.\"\n\nThe blog also served as way to promote Trump's various brands and business ventures, many of which — like the university itself — are gone. In 2006, Trump wrote about his launch of a new travel website called \"GoTrump.com\"\n\n\"I recently put my name on a new travel site, GoTrump.com. It has everything from the ultimate in luxury travel to the absolute best deals on everything from hotels to airfare.\"\n\n\"It's a great site, check it out. It has to be, or I wouldn't have put my name on it.\"\n\n\"I've worked hard to make sure the Trump name is found only on buildings of the highest caliber and products of the finest quality. I won't even consider giving my approval to anything unless I know it's the top of the line because when people see or hear 'Trump,' they expect the best. That's just basic marketing and good business.\"\n\nThe travel site appears to have shut down a year later."

   "ARTICLE": "It happened again.\n\nRoughly four years ago, I excitedly snapped up my first iPad, the third-generation model, which featured the higher-resolution \"Retina Display.\" Less than half a year later, however, my enthusiasm turned to remorse after Apple introduced an upgraded iPad, throwing our expectations for an annual upgrade for a loop and making my \"new iPad\" obsolete.\n\nGuess what I got over the holidays? Yep, a new iPad Air 2.\n\nSo now, of course, Apple is expected to unveil an even newer 9.7-inch iPad just three months later. This iPad, which should be unveiled at the company's Monday event, is likely to add a connector for a keyboard like the larger iPad Pro and to feature other upgrades such as compatibility with its stylus, the Apple Pencil. All of a sudden, I've got iPad envy again.\n\nThis rumored iPad raises the possibility of a worrisome trend. Apple may be looking at multiple versions of its marquee tablet throughout the year, forcing consumers to grapple with a more complex equation of when and which products they want to buy. That only feeds into the growing sense of buyer's remorse about missing out on the next, better thing.\n\nApple is also expected to unveil a new, smaller iPhone at the event. (For all the details as they're announced, tune into CNET's live coverage on Monday starting at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET.) So you too might feel a pang of regret if you've recently bought a sizable iPhone 6S but would have preferred its features in a more petite package.\n\nApple declined to comment ahead of the event.\n\nI'm by no means an opponent of progress. I understand that tech gadgets need to get faster and smarter and include more features over time. But Apple consumers have generally settled into a pattern in which the Cupertino, California, company debuts its new iPhones and iPads around September or October. That kind of predictability is one of the advantages that Apple has had over Android -- you generally know that you're going to have the latest and greatest product for a year if you get one over the holidays.\n\nThe iPad Air 2 is a slightly different case. That tablet debuted in fall 2014, so I get that it's a little long in the tooth. Yet when Apple's September 2015 event came and went without a refresh to its mainstay 9.7-inch product, I felt certain that there wouldn't be a significant upgrade anytime soon. I'll bet that there are many others who read the signals the same way.\n\nIt looks like I'm going to be proven wrong on Monday. Depending on how you look at it, the upgrade is coming either too soon or too late.\n\nApple, after all, did unveil a new tablet in September. But the larger iPad Pro was designed more for business users and hasn't really appealed to mainstream consumers. Yes, size matters, and I wasn't ready for such an unwieldy tablet. Given the tablet sales numbers from Apple, I'm not alone there.\n\nThe company even bumped up the specifications for a new iPad Mini 4 in September, offering fans of the smaller tablet a fresh option. So you can't blame me for assuming no new 9.7-inch iPad when the event came and went with little mention of the iPad Air line.\n\nThis may be a blip in Apple's schedule of new products. Perhaps next year, the company will go back to unveiling its key products in the latter part of the year.\n\nBut for now, I'm wondering if I should be trading in my recently obtained iPad Air 2 for the newer model."

   "ARTICLE": "Apple's newest iPhone is believed to be coming at an event March 21. That means the usual flurry of rumors surrounding the updated smartphone is turning into a full-blown blizzard of speculation, hints and leaks.\n\nA video published Monday purports to show the new iPhone SE in the wild in China. The iPhone SE, if that's what it ends up being called, is rumored to be a smaller phone with a 4-inch screen designed to replace the iPhone 5S for people who don't want a plus-sized model.\n\nThe video comes from a YouTube user by the name of Nick Beeep. Beeep.co is an under-construction crowdtesting site for products. Nick Xu is the founder. Xu visited a vendor at a market in Huaqiangbei Shenzhen in China, an area known as the \"Silicon Valley of Hardware.\"\n\nXu told CNET he heard about the iPhone's presence at the market and asked to shoot a video of it. The sellers didn't agree at first, but later changed their minds and allowed the filming. As with any leak, we have to temper the excitement with some caution. It's possible the phone is a knock-off rather than the real deal.\n\nIn the video, Xu films a woman hosting the look at the supposedly leaked iPhone SE. She says, \"It's more like the mixed blood of iPhone 5S and 6S.\" She describes it as having rounded edges for a smoother touch while still weighing about the same as a 5S.\n\nThe alleged SE phone seems to have a slightly pinker hue than its predecessors and the rear camera bezel is slightly raised. A purported leak of an iPhone 7 case last week hinted at the disappearance of a standard 3.5mm audio jack for the next-gen smartphone. The video leak very clearly shows a jack on the bottom of the professed SE. Apple watchers expect the full-on iPhone 7 to be announced in the fall.\n\nXu also supplied a series of photos of the phone hanging out with the 6S and 5S. Size-wise, it's noticeably smaller than the 6S and about the same as the 5S. If the leak turns out to be true, then 5S fans will be thrilled about having an updated replacement option that's just as dainty. We will know for sure how accurate the video is on March 21 if the Apple announcement goes as expected.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

   "ARTICLE": "If you've been reading the headlines about Apple's fight with the FBI, you know it's easy to assume we're all doomed.\n\nEither law enforcement will lose the ability to thwart terrorist plots, or we'll be forced to live in a police state. Neither of those outcomes is exactly what you'd call appealing.\n\nBut Apple and the US government say those are exactly the things at stake in a court battle playing out in California. The two sides will meet before a magistrate judge on Tuesday in Riverside to make their arguments on whether Apple should build a new version of its mobile software so the FBI can hack into an iPhone 5C used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\nApple argues it shouldn't be forced to make its phones less secure. The company, which has the backing of Silicon Valley notables like Google and Facebook, argues that creating software to break into one phone puts all other iPhone users at risk if the technology falls into the wrong hands. The FBI calls its request \"modest,\" says it can't get into the device without Apple's help, and notes that information on the iPhone 5C could reveal more about the terrorists' activities.\n\nTuesday will be the first chance for both parties to make arguments before Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym. This could drag on for a while, even years. Judge Pym won't make a ruling immediately, and her decision faces appeal, possibly all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Because technology is moving at warp speed, we don't have two to three years to wait for a solution here in this particular case or in the boatload of cases after it,\" said Ed McAndrew, a former federal cybercrimes prosecutor and now a lawyer at Ballard Spahr.\n\nWhile we wait it out, let's look at those worst-case scenarios from each side.\n\nGoing dark\n\nIn the eyes of the FBI, this is about keeping Americans safe. If law enforcement can't get access to data on iPhones, criminals can \"go dark,\" the government says. FBI Director James Comey warned a Congressional committee earlier this month that offering a place no authorities could touch would create a haven for terrorists and criminals.\n\n\"Before these devices came around, there was no closet, basement or drawer in America that could not be entered with a judge's order,\" he said. Privacy is important, Comey said, but so is stopping murder, violence and pedophilia.\n\nA loss in this case could also hurt the FBI's ability to get info from other tech companies, like Facebook.\n\nApple counters the government's warning by saying the FBI shouldn't be fixated on what it can access but realize there's a \"mountain\" of information that now is available because of technology.\n\n\"Going dark -- this is a crock,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during an interview with Time. \"No one's going dark.\"\n\nAnd experts say law enforcement has to find a way to fight crime in a world with strong encryption.\n\n\"The cost of maintaining a free society is that sometimes criminals won't be caught,\" said John Hasnas, a professor of ethics at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. \"Sometimes there are bad things we can't prevent.\"\n\nPolice state\n\nApple says the government is asking for a back door into all iPhones. If the FBI is able to get access to one phone, it'll ask for access to more, the company said. There's also no way to guarantee that the loophole won't fall into the hands of criminals. It would become a top prize for hackers, and Apple undoubtedly would face attacks.\n\nApple also fears the government's demands won't stop with unlocking iPhones. Next, law enforcement could ask for access to an iPhone's camera and microphone to keep tabs on you, Eddy Cue, Apple's head of Internet software and services, said during a recent Univision interview.\n\n\"Where does this stop?\" Cue said. \"In a divorce case? In an immigration case? In a tax case with the IRS? Someday, someone will be able to turn on a phone's microphone. This should not happen in this country.\"\n\nThen there are the international implications. No foreign government has a back door into Apple's products, but if the US government is successful, you can bet other countries, such as China, will come knocking too.\n\nAt stake are the \"very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect,\" Cook said.\n\nThe FBI counters by saying that Apple helped it gain access to devices in the past without causing a loss of privacy and freedoms. Stacey Perino, an FBI electronics engineer, argued in a declaration that even if Apple didn't destroy the new software and criminals got access to it, they couldn't use it to hack all iPhones. That's because the code would run only on an iPhone if it had Apple's unique digital signature, Perino said.\n\nApple disagrees.\n\nFinding middle ground?\n\nEven the American public is split on the issue. According to a poll by CNET sister publication CBS News and The New York Times, half of Americans believe Apple should unlock the phone, while 45 percent think it shouldn't. More than two-thirds of Americans think unlocking the phone will make it at least somewhat likely that other iPhones are more vulnerable to hackers, and 58 percent of Americans remain concerned about losing some privacy in the fight against terrorism.\n\nSome are hoping to find common ground.\n\nApple has recommended that a commission set the parameters for tech's interactions with the government. Two US lawmakers, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, and Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, agree and say they want Congress to form a commission charged with addressing issues on digital security that have put authorities and private companies at odds.\n\n\"Both the FBI and Apple are taking absolutist positions and in many ways are talking past each other,\" Warner said in an interview on Wednesday. \"I do believe there are technology solutions that can protect encryption and not lead to back doors.\"\n\nWarner hopes to have a commission approved within a couple of months and to see the group issue a full report in about a year.\n\nEven if the US comes to some agreement, it won't matter much if other countries have conflicting policies.\n\nIn the end, all it could take is one more attack for everything to change.\n\n\"We know there will be another catastrophic attack on the homeland,\" said a former counterterrorism official at the White House who didn't want to be named. \"When that happens, the privacy-security pendulum will swing wildly back toward the national security side. The public will forget about encryption and will be very willing to give up some of their privacy for enhanced security."

   "ARTICLE": "Every time you think the era of booth babes has passed, something else comes along to make you wonder whether tech has changed at all.\n\nAt Microsoft's official Xbox party on Thursday night at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, dancers entertained in tight bra-like tops and fishnet tights. Their short plaid skirts suggested a sort of comely schoolgirl look.\n\nThat didn't sit well with some attendees, watchdogs and even company officials who note the display runs contrary to the company's said efforts to be more inclusive and to help elevate women in their careers in technology.\n\nMicrosoft didn't say who hired the dancers and even Aaron Greenberg, head of Xbox games marketing, was apparently unaware of what the night had in store.\n\n\"Very disappointed to see this, going to follow up with team,\" Greenberg tweeted on Friday.\n\nThe company later took full responsibility.\n\n\"We represented Xbox and Microsoft in a way that was not consistent or aligned to our values,\" Xbox head Phil Spencer said in a statement, referring to the party. \"It was unequivocally wrong and will not be tolerated. I know we disappointed many people and I'm personally committed to holding ourselves to higher standards. We must ensure that diversity and inclusion are central to our everyday business and core values. We will do better in the future.\"\n\nThe Twitterverse, of course, was not as formal in its response to the party's entertainment.\n\nGiant Spacekat co-founder Brianna Wu, a game developer who has been vocal about antagonistic attitudes toward women in the industry, tweeted: \"Extremely disappointed @Microsoft and @Xbox hired women wearing these outfits to perform at @gd. PLEASE RT.\"\n\nKamina Vincent, who attended the party, tweeted that the party cements her place as a customer of rival console Sony PlayStation. She later added: \"Making a formal complaint tomorrow. I will not stand for this. I'm trying to encourage women into the industry then this happens.\"\n\nIt seems that no matter how obvious the issue is, some eyes remain closed and some ears remain deaf. For all the necessary and strident conversation about the role of women in technology, there are those who believe nothing has changed and every tech festival still celebrates sausages.\n\nBut this was Microsoft, the same company that had, earlier in the conference, sponsored a \"Women In Games\" lunch.\n\nThis is the same Microsoft whose CEO, Satya Nadella, mused that women in tech shouldn't ask for raises, but instead rely on good karma. (He subsequently apologized.)\n\nMicrosoft isn't alone in knowing it should address such attitudes. But then someone goes and spoils it all.\n\nI suspect that someone might be dancing on hot coals today."

   "ARTICLE": "Last time I attempted a road trip in an all-electric car, it ended up on the back of a tow truck. Twice. That's why I decided to try it again, but with double the distance to travel and a huge time constraint hanging over my head.\n\nThe plan this time was to drive 1,000 miles from London, down the whole length of France and into Spain, ending in Barcelona. I'd allowed two days to do it so I'd arrive just in time for Mobile World Congress -- a huge mobile phone trade show that CNET attends every year. I was told in no uncertain terms by my bosses that missing the show was simply not an option.\n\nNo pressure then.\n\nThe car I'd chosen for the journey was a Tesla Model S 90D. With its theoretical range of around 300 miles, I was confident it was the car I'd need to cover the distance ahead. Together with my kind and amazingly patient colleague Luke Westaway -- who captured our trip in the videos embedded below -- I'd carefully planned the route and calculated the distances we had to cover between charging points down to the mile.\n\nA very early start\n\nAt 3 in the morning on a drizzly Thursday, I picked Luke up and we left London, heading 95 miles south to Folkestone. There, we drove the Tesla onto a train carriage, and sped under the sea in the Channel Tunnel before reemerging in northern France, only half an hour later. Just outside Calais was our first stop at one of Tesla's superchargers in the car park of a hotel.\n\nWe'd be relying on Tesla's superchargers the whole way. They deliver huge amounts of power to the car, giving us half our range back from only 20 minutes of charging, with a full charge from flat taking a little over an hour. We gave the car a full charge in Calais -- more than enough to get us to our next stop in Chalons en Champagne, 200 miles away.\n\nAt least, that's what we thought. While the car indicated that we had plenty of range to reach the next charger, the GPS navigation system built into the 17-inch touchscreen insisted that we make a detour to a different charging point in Lille. It seemed that if the GPS found a different charger on the way to our destination, it would always insist we stopped there. We were confused by the mixed signals the car was giving us but, not wanting to get stranded, we erred on the side of caution and headed for Lille.\n\nWhen we arrived at the supercharger, the car still suggested that we had enough range to get us to our next scheduled stopping point. That again made us wonder why it had insisted we make a detour, adding not only driving time but charging time as well. Still, we gave the car a quick 30-minute top-up and then got on the road again.\n\nThe supercharger outside of Chalons en Champagne, 151 miles from Lille, was the first one we found not in the car park of a chain of business hotels -- instead it was next to an independent and quite charming hotel that was also home to two very friendly dogs. That said, as it was still some way from a town centre, we weren't able to spend the charging time buying snacks and water. Also, since the hotel's restaurant was closed (it was off-season), we had to settle for an espresso from the bar while we waited another hour for the car to fully charge.\n\nThe remote location of the Tesla's superchargers became a constant of the trip, but I was impressed that of all those we visited, there was room to charge eight cars at once. On our last road trip through the heart of the UK, we ran into a big problem when the single charging point we reached in Wales -- at the end of the car's range -- was out of order.\n\nOur planned route should have taken us to the supercharger at Beaune, 188 miles away from Chalons en Champagne. Here again, though, the car's GPS had different ideas. It insisted that we stop at an additional supercharger in Auxerre, a 104-mile drive. We heeded its advice and took the detour, but this one was more annoying than our side trip to Lille. Not only did it add over 20 miles of extra driving, it took us along country roads in a rural part of France. The speed limit was lower, so we couldn't travel as fast and the additional braking and accelerating around the corners and out of junctions meant that we weren't driving economically. Not only was it taking us longer to reach the charger, we'd have needlessly burned more range by the time we got there.\n\nFinding our groove\n\nPlaying it safe had serious consequences. All of those additional detours and unscheduled charges made our driving time balloon out of control. While we planned to arrive at our overnight stop in the city of Orange by 6 p.m., by 10 p.m. we were still over 100 miles away. And as we'd been awake since 2 that morning, we decided it was too dangerous to push on so we grabbed two rooms in an Ibis hotel, just south of Lyon. We plugged the car into the hotel's supercharger and bedded down for the night.\n\nAt 6:45 the following morning we unplugged the car from the charger and planned our next stint. We'd learned a lot from the day before; crucially that the car's GPS was overly conservative in its range estimates. So today we would ignore the suggested detours, and instead simply consider how far we had to drive between charges and how much range was available.\n\nThis tactic made for a much more relaxing drive and the chance to really get to know the car. And it's one hell of a car. It has a luscious leather interior, it'll out-accelerate most things on the road and it's packed with tech that makes it an utter dream to drive.\n\nDynamic cruise control kept us at a set speed while slowing down when it detects anything in the road ahead. Sensors on the outside can \"see\" the lines on the road and allow the car to steer itself, always keeping within the lines. A quick tap on the indicator and the car will even change lanes for you. That worked 90 percent of the time and on long stints on motorways (which made up the vast majority of our journey), these features made driving a breeze.\n\nWe even found time to take our own detour, off the motorway and along a coastal road, enjoying the sun and blue sky of the south of France, a glorious change from the grey skies and snow we endured up north. A few hundred miles and three charges in hotel car parks later we had crossed the border into Spain and made our way to Barcelona El Prat airport, where I was to leave the car in storage. We'd made it.\n\nLessons learned\n\nIt wasn't an easy trip, but our second attempt at an all-electric drive was a success. We drove 1,000 miles in the Tesla Model S, clean across the continent from London to Barcelona, powered only by electricity. And not a tow truck to be seen. Even better, Luke and I weren't going to get fired.\n\nOur success shows that electric driving works, even over very long distances. The Tesla is not just great for city driving where chargers are common, it's perfectly capable of eating up the road over long distances, just like any of its petrol-powered cousins.\n\nI did learn a lot though, and here are the main lessons I've taken away:\n\nPlanning is crucial: With electric charging points still far less common than petrol stations, you need to know exactly where your next charge is and whether you have enough range to make it.\n\nNever stop thinking: Your car's range varies heavily based on your driving style, the terrain, traffic and even the weather. Charging times too will depend on whether you're charging a flat battery or a half-full one.\n\nTesla's GPS doesn't always know best: Most of our time problems stemmed from the car's GPS insisting on stopping at extra charging points, even though we had enough range to continue our journey. While we eventually learned to trust that the car had the range to carry on, it always felt a bit risky ignoring the GPS recommendations. Tesla needs to work on its GPS software to give better indications of whether you can make your destination or not.\n\nTesla's chargers are great, but tucked away: The chargers are extremely powerful and are the quickest way to fill up the batteries, but it's a shame that those found across continental Europe seemed to all be in the back of Ibis, Mercure or Novotel hotels. Not only that, but these chain hotels were on the outskirts of towns, far away from shops. While Luke and I were happy to pass the time drinking espressos, if you're travelling with kids, you'll need to take a lot of entertainment for them to pass the time.\n\nAbove all, enjoy the ride: Yes, we had to think about our distances and range a lot more than we would have done in a petrol car, but it made the drive seem like a real adventure. The car was a pleasure to be in and once the weather picked up it was sheer bliss cruising down the continent.\n\nDon't think that electric cars are only limited to cities. As long as you've done the planning, you can enjoy a long-distance electric cruise with no trouble at all."

   "ARTICLE": "When we imagine a future where humans and robots coexist, it doesn't take long for us to arrive at a conclusion where the human race tragically ends. A robot uprising usually occurs, followed by the inevitable enslavement of all humankind. Sometimes dancing is involved.\n\nBut when it comes to the future and what will actually unfold, Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus VR (which Facebook now owns) and inventor of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, isn't sweating it.\n\n\"The reason I'm not creeped out is pretty simple,\" said Luckey, who sat down with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Re/code journalist Kara Swisher on Saturday at the Silicon Valley Comic Con in San Jose, California. \"A lot of people look to science-fiction for representations of technology. It can be exciting. It can also be flawed.\"\n\nCiting movies like \"The Matrix\" and the artificial intelligence (AI) program Skynet from \"The Terminator,\" Luckey disagrees with how both virtual reality and AI are commonly portrayed in science-fiction.\n\n\"It's depicted as a world-ending-nightmarish technology,\" he said. \"It is sensationalism.\"\n\nI believe Luckey is right, and this sensationalism does trickle out of sci-fi books and movies and into our apprehensions and fears toward VR and AI technology. Back in February, people became unsettled after an image of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was captured during a Samsung MWC 2016 press event. In it, a smiling Zuckerberg strides along a packed and darkened room full of people wearing VR headsets.\n\nMany were quick to jump on the image's eerie connotations. CNET rounded up commentary from people who freaked out about it and BGR wrote that the photo was \"creeping out everyone.\" The Verge described the picture as \"a billionaire superman with a rictus grin, striding straight past human drones, tethered to machines and blinded to reality by blinking plastic masks.\"\n\nWhen Zuckerberg posted the photo on Facebook, commenters compared the attendees to zombies, and one user wrote, \"I don't want to live in a world like this. I want to be able to touch a flower in bloom, and smell it. I want to be able to hug someone, and tell them I love them in person.\"\n\nOf course, you can still touch a flower and smell it. VR headsets aren't going to stop you from doing any of those things. They can, however, show you a surrealist Dali painting; how to land a space mission on Mars; or what daily life is like in a refugee camp to raise awareness about the Syrian Civil War.\n\nTrue, it's not all rainbows and butterflies with VR and AI. There are valid concerns right now about potentially harmful content, privacy and security, and the general anti-social nature of these technologies. But Luckey believes these concerns aren't reason enough to not move forward, and as we continually navigate through these issues, the future will be anticlimactic.\n\n\"When we end up having perfect AI, it's going to be a lot more boring than what people imagine,\" he said. \"I don't think it's going to make for a great sci-fi novel.\"\n\nAnd what happens in real life is usually duller than what we let on. The attendees in the Zuckerberg photo were there to see a phone launch. Headsets were placed on every seat and Samsung introduced the phone with a short VR video. Zuckerberg came on stage to talk about integrating 360-video content with social VR apps, then walked off.\n\nIf that's the Orwellian nightmare we were all afraid of, then it included a lot more press releases, wristbands, and cheesy demo videos than I expected.\n\nAs for VR itself, most content revolves around gaming, followed by movies and shows. Then there's good old fashion porn. So you know, business as usual.\n\nThere's always value in approaching technology with a mix of caution and excitement. But I believe our fear of an imminent robot takeover is misplaced. Personally, I'm more afraid of fellow human beings and the harm we're currently inflicting on ourselves. Issues like online harassment, government overreach and spying and Net neutrality concern us all now, but alas, they don't make for sexy headlines.\n\nAs for Luckey, he also isn't too concerned about robots, AI or VR platforms going rogue and leading us into a dystopian future.\n\n\"I think we're going to figure out how to use these technologies for good,\" he said. \"I'm a relentless optimist about this."

   "ARTICLE": "Twitter is turning 10 on Monday.\n\nThe social network has become immensely popular on a very simple theory: Say what you want in 140 characters or fewer. (That sentence is 123 characters, including spaces.)\n\nThough that may not sound like a lot of room to maneuver, Twitter's users have figured out how to craft pithy, playful and poignant messages that have had a role in everything from pop culture moments like the Academy Awards to political upheavals like the Arab Spring.\n\nOver the past decade, the free service has become a go-to platform for politicians, entertainers, activists and everyday people and one of the top sources for breaking news. If there's a catastrophe, folks flock to Twitter to find out the latest. Many of its 320 million tweeters use the service to swap opinions about sporting events as they happen, or to monitor protests, wars or terrorist attacks as they unfold in real time.\n\nDonald Trump, the unexpected Republican front-runner for US president, relies on Twitter to trash his rivals and share his often-unapologetic commentaries. First Lady Michelle Obama helped popularize the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls to call attention to the plight of kidnapped schoolgirls in Nigeria. Whistle-blower Edward Snowden joined Twitter in September 2015 with the ironic phrase \"Can you hear me now?\"\n\nNBA superstar Kobe Bryant used the service in November 2015 to announce his retirement from the Los Angeles Lakers. And former Olympic athlete turned reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner announced herself to the world on Twitter, reaching 1 million followers in less than four hours. That broke President Barack Obama's record for fastest to rack up a million followers.\n\nSingers Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift have the most Twitter followers at nearly 85 million, 77 million and 73 million, respectively. Obama ranks fourth with 71 million, according to TwitterCounter.\n\nTwitter's founders Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone and Noah Glass said their goal was to create a \"public messaging\" service, akin to the way cab drivers and dispatchers communicate. They called it \"a simple way to say something, to anyone, that everyone in the world can see instantly.\"\n\nThe proof is in the tweets. Here's a list of some of the most important ones from the past decade.\n\nOn March 21, 2006, Twitter co-founder and current CEO Jack Dorsey sent out his first tweet: \"just setting up my twttr.\"\n\nThe birth of the first #hashtag, by Chris Messina in 2007:\n\nNASA said there's ice in space, after the Phoenix Mars lander discovered patches of ice on Mars in 2008:\n\nIn 2009, Twitter brought images to the world almost immediately after a US Airways plane with 155 passengers on board struck a bird on takeoff and miraculously landed in the Hudson River near New York City. Twitter user Janis Krums was among the first witnesses on the scene and tweeted a photo that came to symbolize the \"Miracle on the Hudson.\" Dorsey thanked Krums via Twitter, naturally, calling it an \"iconic moment.\"\n\nFollowing a controversial election in Iran in June 2009, thousands began protesting in the streets of Tehran. When the government shut off news about the demonstrations, protesters took to Twitter. The phrase \"Twitter Revolution\" was born.\n\nAstronaut Timothy (TJ) Creamer sent the first live tweet from space, in January 2010: \"Hello Twitterverse!\" He went on to take questions from there.\n\nThe microblogging service played a vital part in the Arab Spring uprisings across Egypt, Tunisia, Syria and Libya in late 2010 and 2011. Demonstrators used the social network as a mobilization tool to coordinate and organize protests. Twitter and other platforms were credited with the ousting of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the resignation of Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak.\n\nSohaib Athar, an IT consultant living in Abbottabad, Pakistan, inadvertently sent live tweets of the US Navy Seals raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011, after noticing helicopters hovering in his neighborhood.\n\nObama celebrated his re-election in November 2012 with a tweet that read \"Four more years\" and included a photo of him embracing the First Lady. It became the most retweeted tweet ever -- until 2014 that is, when it was eclipsed by Ellen DeGeneres' Oscars selfie with A-list celebrities.\n\nThe Boston Globe was among the first to break the news about the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013. More than 27 million tweets were sent discussing the tragedy that killed three people and injured more than 200 others.\n\nThe 2014 World Cup captured the attention and enthusiasm of fans around the globe, who turned it into the most mentioned sporting event in Twitter history. There were more than 672 million tweets during the tournament.\n\nMillions took to Twitter with the hashtag #PrayforParis to show solidarity and peace after terror attacks killed at least 130 people in the city in November 2015. It was the city's second major terror attack. Eleven people were killed and 11 injured at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo earlier that year. That attack spawned the #JeSuisCharlie -- I am Charlie -- hashtag.\n\nLast month, Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar win for Best Actor caused a spike of 440,000 tweets a minute. That broke DeGeneres' Oscar selfie record."

   "SUMMARY": "If you're an Android fan who frequently travels internationally, the Project Fi mobile service could be your ticket to big savings. But there are a few things you should know. CNET's Marguerite Reardon explains.",
   "IMAGE_LINK": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2016/03/18/da05f978-dd45-4dec-a942-52a6c7e69f51/traveler-airport-cell-phone-corbis-hero-3.jpg",
   "ARTICLE": "Google's Project Fi mobile service can save you big bucks, especially if you're traveling internationally. But it might not be a good fit for everyone.\n\nIn this edition of Ask Maggie I explain the ins and outs of Project Fi, Google's wireless service that runs off of the Sprint and T-Mobile networks. I also highlight why some people might want to think twice before ditching their old carrier to join Google's mobile revolution.\n\nDear Maggie,\n\nI'm planning a trip abroad this summer. I read your Ask Maggie column last week that offered advice on how to take your cell phone international without spending an arm and a leg. I saw some comments after the story about Google's Project Fi as an inexpensive alternative to a traditional carrier when traveling. I'm a Verizon customer with an iPhone 6. Should I ditch Verizon and sign up for Project Fi ahead of my trip?\n\nThanks,\nConfused About Wireless\n\nDear Confused,\n\nThe short answer to your question is a big \"maybe.\" Project Fi could definitely save you some money, both domestically and abroad. But there are a few limitations you should be aware of before you jump ship.\n\nWhat is Project Fi?\n\nProject Fi is Google's attempt to shake up the wireless industry with cheaper plans. The service uses a combination of cellular coverage from T-Mobile and Sprint and local Wi-Fi networks. A key aspect of Project Fi's service is technology that determines which network offers the best connection, allowing it to seamlessly switch among these networks if one connection weakens.\n\nSince its launch last April, Project Fi has largely been an experiment, with the service available only by invitation. Earlier this month, Google opened the service up to everyone, making it easy to sign on.\n\nThe biggest benefit of Project Fi is its low cost. Users in the US pay $20 a month for unlimited calls and texts. Adding data costs $10 for each gigabyte used. If customers don't use their allotted amount in a month, they get a credit for unused data the next month. If you go over your data allotment, you're charged for the additional data. This is appealing to a lot of people, because you truly pay for what you use.\n\nThe great news for international travelers is that you can still get unlimited text messaging and Project Fi doesn't charge roaming rates for data usage in more than 120 countries. This means it still costs $10 per gigabyte of data. This is a huge benefit considering that Verizon charges $2.05 per megabyte of data. (Keep in mind that voice service is charged on a per minute basis, and prices vary depending on the country you're visiting.)\n\nBecause Project Fi is always looking for the best network connection and the service tries to connect you to a Wi-Fi signal, you may actually use less data than you would on a traditional cellular carrier, which will reduce your costs even more. (Wi-Fi is not counted against your monthly data usage.) For your protection, Project Fi uses a secure connection even over public Wi-Fi networks.\n\nOK, so what's the catch?\nThe biggest downside for you is that Project Fi is available only on LG's Nexus 5X, Motorola's Nexus 6 and Huawei's Nexus 6P. This means you'd have to buy a new phone and leave the Apple iPhone ecosystem if you wanted to switch to Project Fi.\n\nThe other potential downside is that when you're in the US and Wi-Fi isn't available, you'll be roaming on either Sprint or T-Mobile. Their networks aren't as widespread as Verizon's, so this means that depending on where you live and work, you may get spotty coverage when Wi-Fi isn't available. But if you live and work in an urban area, you may not notice the difference in coverage, since both Sprint and T-Mobile work pretty well in most big US cities. Both have been steadily improving with their 4G speeds as well.\n\nWhat should you do?\nIf you plan to travel outside the US often and you live in an area where Sprint and T-Mobile coverage isn't an issue, switching to Project Fi and getting a new Nexus 5X, which is now only $199 when bought with Project Fi service, might be the way to go. You'd definitely save money on your trip and you'd likely save money at home.\n\nBut if the trip this summer is a once-in-a-lifetime or even a-once-every-five-years affair, it might not be worth it for you to make the leap, especially if you're satisfied with Verizon at home. The Nexus 5X gets high marks from reviewers, but it's not an iPhone. Some people are happy making the switch between Apple and Android, others aren't. I hope this advice helps.\n\nAsk Maggie is an advice column that answers readers' wireless and broadband questions. If you have a question, I'd love to hear from you.

   "ARTICLE": "The days of celebrating a specific body type over another is coming close to an end.\n\nIn 2015, we began to unravel the stigma created by a world filled with Photoshop and diet fads, and the conversation of body diversity was put front and center in the showbiz world.\n\nWherever you looked—magazines, blogs, news sites, social media—there seemed to be another celebrity chiming in and working towards advancing the movement of embracing our bodies and loving ourselves the way that we are. \n\nIn 2016, that move towards self-love has not slowed, and many celebrities have continued to speak up, turning themselves into positive role models.\n\nStars who are unhappy with the industry standard, where the female body is constantly tagged with labels such as \"plus-sized,\" or affectionately, \"curvy,\" are concerned about the impact this may have on the impressionable younger generation. \n\nHere are 10 female celebs who have taken it upon themselves to speak out about loving the body you have:\n\n1. Jennifer Aniston: The former Friends star has been a longtime advocate for embracing your body. The best thing about Jennifer is that taking advice from her feels like taking advice from a friend who's comforting you over a hot cup of coffee. \n\n\"All bodies are beautiful,\" the starlet tells Refinery29. \"Let's face it. We are so overly critical of ourselves—with the obsession with perfection, trying to reach a goal that's unrealistic.\" \n\nHer ultimate advice? \"We should take care of what we have and not take it for granted, because it's our one body.\"\n\n2. Jennifer Lawrence: We all know and love J.Law for telling it like it is, and the Hunger Games star is extremely candid when it comes to body image issues. Fortunately for us all, the quick-witted 25-year old is taking a stand against these issues and claiming her role as a positive body-image advocate.\n\n\"I would like us to make a new normal-body type,\" she tells Harper's Bazaar, \"Everybody says, 'We love that there is somebody with a normal body!' And I'm like, 'I don't feel like I have a normal body.' I do Pilates every day. I eat, but I work out a lot more than a normal person. I think we've gotten so used to underweight that when you are a normal weight it's like, 'Oh, my God, she's curvy.'\"\n\n3. Amy Schumer: Our favorite funnylady is huge in the self-image movement. \nAmy has said several times that she is totally happy and proud to be a healthy size 6, but recently, the Trainwreck actress took to Instagram to question her inclusion in a special edition issue of Glamour, which focused on plus-size celebrities, such as Sports Illustrated cover girl Ashley Grahamand comedienne Melissa McCarthy.\n\nNot one to keep quiet on issues that matter, Schumer reacted. \"I think there's nothing wrong with being plus-size, beautiful, healthy women. Plus-size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and an 8. @glamourmag put me in their plus size only issue without asking or letting me know and it doesn't feel right to me. Young girls seeing my body type thinking that is plus size? What are your thoughts? Mine are not cool glamour not glamorous.\"\n\n4. Melissa McCarthy: Obviously, the actress is an inspiration. Not only does her success continue to rise in show business, but The Boss star is also releasing a successful fashion line. \n\nIn an interview with Redbook for its April 2016 issue, McCarthy discussed body positivity and wanting to make a difference in women's lives by inspiring them to love their bodies.\n\n\"With women, there's this constant weird cultural thing where we're always supposed to be comparing ourselves with one another. Who wore it best? Whose butt's better?\" McCarthy said regarding body love. \n\n\"A good portion of women in America are size 14 and higher. I just try to make clothing that'll make all women feel really good...When I feel good about my clothes, I'm more patient with my kids...The small happy moments add up. A little bit of joy goes a long way,\" she continues, \"...There's an epidemic in our country of girls and women feeling bad about themselves based on what .5 percent of the human race looks like. It starts very young.\" \n\nThe body-love proponent's final message is that, \"...as long as everybody's healthy, enjoy and embrace whatever body type you have.\"\n\n5. Amber Riley: Beautiful and insanely talented, you wouldn't think this soulful singer-actress would have a tough time getting a gig.\n\nHowever, Riley has powered through her fair share of discrimination, and those experiences may have helped her get her new role as Effie in Dreamgirls, the Broadway musical, and give life with the character, who she says she identifies with. \n\n\"I'm not sure if it's life imitating art or art imitating life, but I understand something of what Effie was going through. I do know being a black woman who is plus-sized in Hollywood, you're going to face more rejection than acceptance,\" Riley told Broadway World. \n\nAmber took to Instagram to tell the world how she felt about herself, giving some much-needed inspiration and encouragement to her 710,000 followers, \"I am a beautiful, courageous, black, African Queen with more curves than highways and more lumps than my mother's potato salad and you will deal.\"\n\n6. Cameron Diaz: Known for appreciating the bod she was given, Diaz wrote two books that support this very topic, The Body Book and The Longevity Book. \n\nOn her website, Cameron explains that she believes we all need to embrace ageing. In the days of Botox, face lifts, and Photoshop, that doesn't seem to be a popular opinion.\n\n\"I'm so excited to continue the conversation because learning that you can age well, will actually help you age better,\" Diaz posted on her Instagram, \"If you understand how your body works, then you can take action to help keep it in the best possible condition so it can carry you through a long and beautiful life.\" \n\n7. Emily Ratajkowski: The model is a strong proponent of women's equality, and she speaks out about the body issues she has faced in her Lenny Letter, confessing that she has been made to feel either uncomfortable or guilty for the way she looks, and reveals she had been warned to tune down her sexiness or she might get hurt. \n\n\"I hear the voices reminding me not to send the wrong message,\" the model wrote.\n\n\"I refuse to live in this world of shame and silent apologies. Life cannot be dictated by the perceptions of others, and I wish the world had made it clear to me that people's reactions to my sexuality were not my problems, they were theirs.\"\n\n8. Mindy Kaling: Who doesn't love this TV star? The adorable and hilarious actress is a big player when it comes to promoting body diversity, which is even often addressed on her show, The Mindy Project. \n\n\"You know what's funny? If I call myself a cute, chubby girl, the natural kind woman's response is, 'You're not chubby! You're beautiful! And thin!'\" Kaling told The Guardian, \"And I always want to hug the person and say, 'It's OK, I identify as someone who is cute and chubby—that doesn't mean I'm not worthy of love and attention and intimacy.'\"\n\nIn the same interview, she was extremely honest and admitted that she does have times when she tries to conform to traditional standards of beautiful, but, according to her, she is \"not remotely successful at it.\" \n\nShe makes sure to add, \"I never want to be part of the problem. I want to always be as body-positive as girls hope that I am.\"\nYou're doing a great job so far, Mindy! \n\n9. Sophia Bush: This star is the definition of fierce and has strong opinions about self-empowerment and body love.\nThe Chicago P.D. star does not desire to be anyone else's definition of \"enough,\" and she spreads messages of body positivity on her social media accounts to influence her fans and followers to be more empathetic towards themselves. \n\n\"We are all made in different shapes and sizes,\" Bush reposted the mission statement of an outstanding 9-year-old girl in an Instagram post, \"We need to love our bodies!\"\n\nIn 2014, Sophia appeared on the Today show, and spoke about her favorite charity, I Am That Girl, which works to encourage girls to feel strong, secure, and beautiful in their own bodies.\n\n\"Hey, yeah I'm going to embrace my body and own it for me, not anyone else. And I'm curvy. I'm not some rail-thin, 6-foot-tall runway model who was just born that way. I was born like this. And that's A-OK,\" the actress stated powerfully.\n\n10. Demi Lovato: The \"Confident\" singer has always been endearingly open and honest about her own struggles, and the celeb has been candid when it comes to her body image issues.\n\nWhen Fitness Magazine asked Demi what advice she would give other women who deal with similar hurdles, she replied, \"We all have problem areas. I'm always going to have thick thighs. I can't change that, and obsessing over it will only make me miserable. Learning to be grateful for our bodies and taking care of them are the best ways for us to empower ourselves physically, mentally, and spiritually.\" \n\nShe also learned to embrace her Latina genetics and culture, admitting to Glam Belleza Latina, \"I tried to conform to what everyone thinks is beautiful. But my genetics gave me a curvy figure, and I've come to understand that in the Latina culture, that is beautiful. I no longer look at my body and think, 'Oh my gosh, I have such a fat butt.' Or, 'I hate my thighs.' On some days, I don't love them. But, you know, that's one of the things that makes me me."

   "SUMMARY": "Movies taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have been summer blockbuster hits year after year. Here is a ranked list of the top Marvel movies since \"Iron Man\" released in 2008.",
   "IMAGE_LINK": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/56c766016e97c662008b85e7-1200/1-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014.jpg",
   "ARTICLE": "Ever since \"Iron Man\" was released in 2008 and kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel has taken over the box office.\n\nIn the past eight years, Marvel Studios has put out well over 20 movies that span multiple studios — from Disney to 20th Century Fox. \n\n\"Deadpool,\" which came out on February 12, has been shattering records since its opening weekend. It has grossed over $679.1 million worldwide.\n\nIn anticipation of the upcoming \"Captain America: Civil War\" and \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" we ranked the 12 best Marvel movies we've seen since Robert Downey Jr.'s era-defining \"Iron Man.\"\n\n12. \"The Wolverine\" (2013)\n\nThe hugely entertaining \"The Wolverine\" stays true to the characters' roots while telling an unconventional superhero story that involves Yakuza gangsters. There's a lot of great action here, such as a train chase that is as memorable as it is implausible. What really makes this stand out is Hugh Jackman, who has committed to this character for so long. He's a hero who is immortal and haunted by the prospect of death.\n\n11. \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (2012)\n\nSpider-Man didn't need to be rebooted, but Sony really didn't want to lose this franchise. While nothing can top what Sam Raimi created — even if \"Spider-Man 3\" didn't do anybody any favors — the first reboot had a lot of great stuff to offer. It has a whole new Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) who's less of a geek. And Parker created the web blasters this time, making it just slightly more faithful to the comics.\n\n10. \"Ant-Man\" (2015)\n\nWith Edgar Wright originally onboard, \"Ant-Man\" was looking to be one of Marvel's best. Indeed, Joss Whedon even called it Marvel's best script yet. But when Wright and the studio couldn't see eye to eye, the director dropped out.\n\nReplacement director Peyton Reed had high expectations to live up to. He crafted a superhero story that goes through the standard motions of an origin story while also managing to be a fun heist movie with great performances by Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas. We will never know what Edgar Wright's \"Ant-Man\" would have looked like, but the version we ended up with isn't so bad.\n\n9. \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008)\n\nThe second time is the charm. This semi-sequel, semi-reboot of 2003's dismal \"Hulk\" gets a lot right in that it's fun and filled with action from the start. At times, it also treats Bruce Banner's (Edward Norton) transformation like a horror movie. While a standalone Hulk movie with Mark Ruffalo doesn't seem to be happening in the near future, at least we have one good \"Hulk\" movie to enjoy.\n\n8. \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" (2014)\n\nLike any good sequel, \"Winter Soldier\" completely ups the ante. It adds a new hero along with a surprising villain. If you aren't a hardcore Marvel fan, it's easy to get lost among the endless tie-ins. But you don't have to be a voracious comic reader to appreciate some top-notch action. And the directors, the Russo brothers, know how to put on a show.\n\n7. \"Deadpool\" (2015)\n\n\"Deadpool\" is the rare R-rated superhero movie. Between the excessive violence and liberal use of the F-bomb, it certainly earns its rating. It helps that Ryan Reynolds, who plays the masked hero, had been trying to get the film made for 10 years. His enthusiasm for the role is infectious. With its somewhat stale fourth-wall breaking, \"Deadpool\" isn't quite as edgy as it thinks it is, but it's more than fun enough.\n\nMost importantly, it does what many other Marvel movies couldn't: seamlessly tie itself in with a larger universe. The union of Deadpool with X-Men here just feels natural.\n\n6. \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" (2011)\n\nBefore Captain America (Chris Evans) joined up with The Avengers, he was given this blast of an adventure movie. Set during World War II, \"The First Avenger\" feels like a throwback to \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\"\n\n5. \"Iron Man\" (2008)\n\nThis is when the game changed.\n\n\"Iron Man\" touched a nerve by setting much of its action in a war ripped from the headlines (Afghanistan). Most importantly, it reintroduced Robert Downey Jr. to the world as a movie star. He transforms Iron Man into a superhero worthy of the big screen like no other: a wise-cracking egomaniac who cares as much about saving the world as he does about letting everybody know that he's actually Tony Stark.\n\n4. \"The Avengers\" (2012)\n\nThe first \"Avengers\" movie was a big gamble. It was the first time the likes of Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor would share a screen together. Ultimately, the gamble paid off hugely. Joss Whedon brought this epic to life in a sincere and tongue-in-cheek manner. It says a lot when your post-credits scene is mainly your heroes sitting around a table eating shawarma.\n\nBut what every great superhero movie needs is a great villain. While it is cathartic to watch Bruce Banner declare, \"I'm always angry,\" the real reason to stick around is for Tom Hiddleston's sadistically charming Loki.\n\n3. \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" (2014)\n\n\"Days of Future Past\" is a sequel to a mediocre reboot that also happens to be the best X-Men movie yet. The time-travel behind it works because the stakes are so high that it never seems convoluted. Come for the amazing Quicksilver scene, stay for the lessons on civil rights.\n\n2. \"Iron Man 3\" (2013)\n\nAfter a disastrous second outing, the \"Iron Man\" series rebounded with this fantastic closing to the trilogy. This time, the legendary Shane Black was hired to write and direct. In his third entry, Tony Stark loses his legendary suit for a long time and has to fight with nothing but his wits. That, and an interesting villain, make for one of the most unique superhero movies ever made.\n\n1. \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014)\n\nLet's be clear: \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is not a superhero movie. Its own director has said so. This is what makes it the best Marvel movie there is. It doesn't get bogged down in an origin story or an explanation of powers. In the midst of the Cinematic Universe, this is a movie that connects with hardcore fans and casual viewers alike.\n\n\"Guardians\" proved that Chris Pratt is a movie star and that Vin Diesel could bring tears to your eyes while playing a talking tree. The whole thing has a sharp sense of humor and self-awareness that never borders on self-hatred. Here is a comic-book movie that defies all the rules of comic-book movies, but at the same time, loves the fact that it is one."

   "ARTICLE": "The Divergent Series: Allegiant\" brings us a step closer to the end of the film adaptations of the popular YA novels by Veronica Roth. And for critics, it can't come soon enough.\n\nThe franchise headed by Shailene Woodley set in a dystopian future is crawling to the finish line with nowhere near the popularity, among critics or audiences, of Lionsgate's other YA franchise, \"The Hunger Games.\"\n\nIn \"Allegiant,\" Tris (Woodley) goes beyond the giant wall encircling Chicago to see what's out there.\n\nWith only an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of this writing and hitting a franchise low for Thursday box office (weekend projections has it making around $30 million), \"Allegiant\" is already a certified dud. Few seem interested in going over the wall with Tris.\n\nHere's what critics are saying about it.\n\nThe franchise's storytelling has gone out the window.\n\n\"A story that kicked off two years ago at a reasonable gallop has now slowed to barely a limp,\" notes the New York Times in its review, which sums up the franchise's unoriginal storytelling. \n\nTime Out London pinpointed the problem by writing, \"As internal logic goes out of the window and the plot contrivances pile up (‘I’ve got a machine that can see through walls!’ or ‘I know how to fly a plane without ever having seen one before!’), the film becomes increasingly trying.\"\n\nVariety believes that \"asking audiences to turn off their brains basically reduces 'The Divergent Series' to just another sci-fi action franchise — and not a very good one at that.\"\n\nWhy it can’t hold a candle to \"Hunger Games.\"\n\nTurns out Lionsgate is 1 for 2 in sci-fi YA franchises. While \"Hunger Games\" had an impressive run, and will likely continue with spin-offs, the \"Divergent\" series hasn't had the same luck. The critics have a few reasons why: \n\n\"Unlike the Panem of 'The Hunger Games' saga, which takes real historical tyrannies as an inspiration, there's no getting around the fact that 'Divergent' is a clunky apparatus built around a trendy 'Chosen One' type,\" NPR writes. \n\n\"'Games' created complex characters with psychological depth and emotional heft, and put them at risk while tackling bleak futuristic narrative themes,\" says the San Jose Mercury News. \"'Divergent,' on the other hand, gets snarled up in the threads of an overly complicated vision, stranding its rather one-note characters in the process.\"\n\nMiles Teller's talent is wasted.\n\nIt's been a knock on the franchise from the beginning: Miles Teller's talents are just not being used to their potential.\n\n\"These movies really enjoy denying their characters forward momentum,\" according to the A.V. Club, which points out Teller specifically. \"For the third movie in a row, his character Peter tags along with the heroes before turning duplicitous and selfish.\"\n\nAnd according to the Chicago Tribune: \"The only wild card remains Miles Teller, stuck in supporting-underminer duty but extracting a laugh or two simply by turning his boredom with the material into sly commentary conducted in the margins.\"\n\nWait, there's another movie coming in the franchise?\n\nYes, taking a page from \"Hunger Games\" and \"Twilight,\" the producers are splitting the final chapter of the franchise into two parts. It truly ends in 2017 with the film \"Ascendant.\" \n\nBut for Rolling Stone, they could have just stopped at \"Allegiant,\" or that's how it seems from how the magazine started its review: \"If you're not mad as hell, so mad that you're not gonna take it anymore, then you damn well ought to be.\" \n\nBut then there were critics who didn't even realize there would be another movie.\n\n\"As I walked out of 'Allegiant,' I was confused,\" wrote ComingSoon.net. \"This movie ended as if there was going to be a fourth movie, yet at the time I didn’t know about 'Ascendant.' I only knew there were three books. Were they splitting the last book in two? Was there even going to be a fourth movie? Even the screening reps didn’t seem to know for sure."

   "ARTICLE": "When Paul Reubens created the Pee-wee Herman character in the early 1980s as a stage act, audiences instantly fell in love with not just the exterior — tight-fitting gray suit, red bow tie, unusual voice — but his childlike admiration for life and all its quirkiness.\n\nPee-wee then became a household name when Reubens structured the act as a children's TV show, then teamed with Tim Burton to make the classic \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure.\"\n\nWith Netflix seemingly eager to bring back just about anything we're nostalgic for from the past few decades — \"Full House,\" \"Gilmore Girls\" — it jumped at the chance to make a new Pee-wee movie with Reubens and producer Judd Apatow.\n\nAnd I'm here to tell you that \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\" is as much fun as the first Pee-wee movie. (Let's just pretend \"Big Top Pee-wee\" never existed, OK?)\n\nThis time, Pee-wee is settled in the quaint 1950s-ish town that he's lived in his whole life. But then actor Joe Manganiello shows up — his name in the movie is Joe Manganiello — on his motorcycle and completely wows Pee-wee with his cool style. This motivates Pee-wee to do something he's never done in his life: leave town and take a holiday.\n\nThat's right, in this Pee-wee universe, he never went to the Alamo to find his bike, like he did in \"Big Adventure.\"\n\nBut as with \"Big Adventure,\" Pee-wee embarks on a hilarious road trip that leads to strange encounters. Just a couple — that won't spoil anything as they are featured in the trailer — involve three female bank robbers who are dressed like they came straight out of \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" and a team of unique hairstylists.\n\nThere's a lot of fun in the silly gadgets featured throughout, from how Pee-wee wakes up every morning to the items of a traveling salesman Pee-wee gets a ride from.\n\nIn many ways, Reubens, who cowrote the screenplay with \"Love\" creator and star Paul Rust, uses the structure of \"Big Adventure\" to tell the story. There's a silly opening dream sequence, the road-trip storyline, and the goal of the trip, which is wackier this time around than finding his bike.\n\nAnd then there's just Reubens' strange brand of humor that works as well today as it did in the '80s. I defy you not to laugh out loud during the balloon bit.\n\nYet the secret weapon of the movie, its modern touch, is Manganiello. He is extremely funny and has a chemistry with Reubens that you'd never think would work until you see it on the screen for yourself.\n\n\"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\" is available to stream on Netflix starting on Friday."

   "ARTICLE": "The genius of Futurama was in how its pizza-delivery-guy hero, frozen for 1,000 years, stepped into a new millennium without missing a beat—still poor, still a lovelorn dork, still a delivery guy. People can change, the show allowed, but time and technology won’t do it for them. That can be a difficult lesson, and every new advancement only seems to make it harder.\n\nCreative Control, a droll and deservingly self-satisfied new indie, is effectively a feature-length exploration into the root cause of that phenomenon. Unfolding like a live-action Ghost in the Shell as directed by a young Noah Baumbach, the film is set approximately six minutes from now—far enough into the future that every computer monitor is made out of clear glass, but still near enough to the present that no one can find reliable cellphone reception in New York City.\n\nPoised between the way we live now and the way we hope to live next, the film wends through a queasily familiar Brooklyn where everyone is waiting for tomorrow to make them better than they are today, and struggling to understand that simply showing up isn’t going to do the trick.\n\nDirector Benjamin Dickinson (a veteran of the commercial business whose only previous feature was the fascinating but little-seen First Winter) stars as David, a young adman at the kind of overbearingly male Brooklyn agency where everyone thinks they work at Sterling Cooper but looks like they work at Vice. The office culture is summed up by an exchange in which an industry veteran asks a co-worker “Are you a fucking genius?” to which the co-worker replies: “No, I’m just younger than you.”\n\nWhen our story begins, David has been assigned to the biggest client in his company’s history. The product is a pair of Warby Parker–looking glasses called Augmenta, billed as the first “actually convincing” augmented reality system. The device essentially turns the human brain into an operating system.\n\nWhen a user puts them on, real life appears magically enhanced: Facial recognition software determines people’s names, algorithms identify the brand of their clothes, and sophisticated graphics imagine what they might look like without them on.\n\nIt’s a powerful tool. In fact, the company behind Augmenta doesn’t really know the full extent of what their product can do. In a flourish of foreshadowing, one member of the development team frames the situation thusly: The firm’s competitors are “out there masturbating while we’re in here actually fucking.” Inside or out, everyone is still just thinking about sex.\n\nThat’s especially true for David, who’s given a pair of the glasses to test-drive and immediately uses them to create a malleable avatar of Sophie (Alexia Rasmussen), his best friend’s girlfriend. As his relationship with his own girlfriend (Nora Zehetner, the femme fatale from Brick) deteriorates, David finds himself becoming increasingly involved with Sophie, whether in the flesh or just in the world that exists in the glass on his face. A plastic infinity of information is at his fingertips, and all he can think about is how he can use it to engineer more immersive fantasizes about his forbidden crush. The more we augment reality, Dickinson seems to suggest, the more we reveal what’s true about ourselves.\n\nIt’s an ethos that’s reflected in the look of the film, as Adam Newport-Berra’s lustrous, anamorphic black-and-white cinematography makes Brooklyn simultaneously appear both more retrograde and more advanced—seen in high contrast from the window of David’s apartment, the marquee of Williamsburg’s Wythe Hotel could have been transplanted from either East Germany or Alphaville.\n\nThe aesthetic, complemented by dashes of timeless classical music, effectively creates an alien Williamsburg that often feels more accurate than the one our own eyes allow us to see. That temporal confusion provides the perfect backdrop for the film’s ingeniously lo-fi visual effects, which make Augmenta more convincingly tactile than the technology of Minority Report or its legion of imitators. Even if Creative Control had nothing more to offer it would be valuable evidence that CG, applied with purpose and grace, can be a powerful tool for low-budget filmmakers.\n\nIf Ex Machina beating The Force Awakens at the Oscars didn’t already make it clear, the future of FX isn’t in spectacle but in sensation.\n\nAnd sensation—the difference between seeing and feeling—is what this story is about. For all of the film’s precise and articulate compositions (from its fluid long-take opening to its cruelly succinct last shot), the most resonant image in Creative Controlmight be one of David masturbating alone on his couch as he drools over the mind-blowing illusion in his glasses—it’s futuristic from his perspective, and embarrassingly primitive from ours. Boys and their toys.\n\nMercifully, Creative Control is neither a screed against the evils of new technology nor a satire of the luddites who retreat from it as a moral imperative. It has disdain for Silicon Valley “disruptors” and for people who can’t wait to tell you they don’t own a TV.\n\nDavid isn’t an especially likable or interesting guy, and Dickinson overestimates our patience for him during the film’s less focused second half, but this deceptively savage film spares a little empathy for everyone. Every character is as much asshole as victim, and none of them seem to deserve the relationships they’re disrespecting or the opportunities that fall into their laps. But that’s the dirty secret at the crux of new technologies and the advertising engine that makes us lust after them: Our ideals seldom line up with our interests.\n\nCaptivatingly confident, unsparingly wry, and agreeably cynical about how the black mirror of technology can reveal our worst qualities by reflecting our best selves, Creative Control is the rare blast of speculative fiction that has the temerity not to limit itself to rhetorical questions. “At any given moment there are a million things vying for our attention,” one character declares. “So where do we let our attention fall?” The answer, Creative Control suggests, is always on ourselves."

   "SUMMARY": "Although best-selling author J.K. Rowling's success from the Harry Potter franchise has a magically large fan-base, some are not happy with her new writings and portrayal of Native American culture.",
   "IMAGE_LINK": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/561856765afbd33a718b4567-800-452/us-reassesses-columbus-day-native-american-plight-in-focus.jpg",
   "ARTICLE": "While Harry Potter fans worldwide have breathlessly awaited J.K. Rowling’s latest installment that explores her universe of witches and wizards, the best-selling author has recently drawn ire for her portrayal of Native Americans in her “History of Magic in North America,” published Tuesday on Pottermore.com.\n\nIn her story, Ms. Rowling applies her imaginary world of witches and wizards into Native American history.\n\nIt’s the first of a four-part series meant to “enlighten readers about a previously unexplored corner of the wizarding world,” a Pottermore statement says, “and introduces audiences to a new era of the world that J.K. Rowling has created.”\n\nBut there’s a problem. Substantial elements of “the wizarding world” are, to many Native Americans, part of tribal reality – not fiction – and some scholars say Rowling failed to address the diverse cultures of native people in a fair and respectful way. Native Americans were and still remain, after all, marginalized in the fringes of American society.\n\nBoth on the page and off, Rowling has been an outspoken champion of human rights and social justice. She founded the nonprofit organization Lumos, which aims to improve the lives of children who live in institutions and orphanages around the world, and has passionately spoken out against LGBT discrimination.\n\nBut the author’s latest retelling of North American history, critics say, is shortsighted and lacking in research.\n\nTara Houska, a tribal rights attorney, said she was excited when she’d heard that Rowling will incorporate Native American history into the Harry Potter world. But when she read the stories, she found them disappointing.\n\n“It was this kind of a happy telling of colonization, the story of pilgrims, wizards being forced out of Europe and discovering the new world, with Native Americans in these primitive stereotypes,” she tells The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nAnd the fact that Rowling lumped the vast array of Native tribes into one category of people, Ms. Houska added, is problematic. There are currently 567 federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, and nations in the US.\n\nRowling, for instance, alludes to “legend of the Native American ‘skin walker’” when, in fact, only the Navajo tribe recognizes this lore.\n\nCritics also say that, in Rowling's conflation of diverse Native cultures, some of whom hold sorcery as a real and sensitive topic, it’s obvious that she neglected to consult with any tribal experts.\n\n“Ultimately I think she may have needed to vet this a little bit, by asking tribal people who are very willing to share what they feel is appropriate to share some of these ideas,” says Walter Fleming, the head of the Native American Studies department at Montana State University.\n\n“And I don’t think it would have taken so long before someone would say, ‘we have problems with this.’”\n\nThe biggest challenge, Mr. Fleming tells The Monitor, was for Rowling to have recognized that charms, potions, and spirituality are already deeply entrenched in Native cultures.\n\n“It’s very flattering that she would want to extend her world into [the Native American] world, but it’s not a very good fit, because it’s too good of a fit,” he explains. “What happens is that you’re taking an assumptive fictional community – the wizarding world – and you’re trying to apply it to a culture where it’s not an assumptive fictional world. There are elements that are believed and practiced.”\n\nFor instance, some Native tribes really do believe that “charms” have certain powers, and that “medicine men” can conjure supernatural abilities to heal wounds. But when Rowling renders such concepts in a fictional context, the pertinent cultures are thereby simplified, or even erased, to become stereotypes. \n\nRowling's depictions become all the more dangerous, Houska says, because these misconceptions of Native people already exist in American culture.\n\n“Her fiction isn’t far off from what kids are learning in school books,” she says. Houska recalls being the only Native student in a school of white kids, and how discouraging it was to be taught a skewed version of her culture’s history.\n\n“It’s difficult to be already an extreme minority that’s marginalized to read a history that paints us as these savage people that died out,” she adds. “It’s hard as a kid to go through that.”\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based attorney, who also works as the Native American advisor to presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and is a leader in the Native-led Honor the Earth organization, reached out to Rowling on Twitter Wednesday afternoon, using the Ojibwe word for \"thank you.\"\n\nRowling has yet to address the criticism, but some of her fans have jumped to her defense.\n\nNative representation in media, advocates say, is always important, as such populations are routinely compartmentalized in historical narratives and are still reeling from government policies, both historical and recent, that have harmed the livelihood of tribal reservations. According to 2014 report by Pew Research, one in four Native Americans and Alaska Natives live in poverty – far above the national average of 14.5 percent.\n\n“I certainly don’t want people to think that they can’t write about Native Americans, but I think there are ways to go about it that are a lot more respectful,” Houska says.\n\n“Talk to a tribe, talk to someone who can give you a more informed perspective. And that’s part of the problem across the board, is that Native Americans are still left out of the conversation.”\n\nRead the original article on Christian Science Monitor. Copyright 2016."
